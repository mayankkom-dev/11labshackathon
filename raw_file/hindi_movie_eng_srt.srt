1
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:44,254
Agastya! Do you remember
what day it is today?

2
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:47,421
So far from Earth.
What difference does that make?

3
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:51,004
Whether it's Monday or Friday,
every day is the same to us.

4
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:55,879
No, stupid! Remember,
exactly a year ago, this day..

5
00:02:56,217 --> 00:03:00,109
..we have left earth on this mission
is 25th August.

6
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,971
25th August! Oh, my God!

7
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,301
What happened?

8
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:08,801
I forgot to call my friend, Suhan.

9
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:10,384
Today is his birthday.

10
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:11,842
Suhan?

11
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:14,051
Yes! He is an old friend of mine.

12
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,219
From Houston?

13
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,884
No. From Mumbai, India.

14
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,634
From India?
- Yes.

15
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,534
Well, what exactly
are you trying to do..

16
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:26,592
..calling someone in India
at 5 in the morning?

17
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,509
That's true.

18
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:38,092
Well. Now that you have a couple
of hours before you call him..

19
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:41,301
..why don't you tell me
about your friend, Suhan?

20
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:45,092
Well. Where do I start from?

21
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:47,551
Suhan.

22
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,967
Let me start before I met him.

23
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,760
He was a total madman.

24
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,051
Welcome to the
18th Annual Filmfare Awards.

25
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,384

And brothers and sisters,
now you're eager..

35
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:39,329
..to know the name of the year's
best actor. Aren't you?

36
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,295
Then listen with bated breath.

37
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:49,174
The award for the superstar of
the year goes to Suhan Kapoor.

38
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:07,587
Thank you.

39
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:16,712
Good evening, everybody.

40
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:19,795
And thank you, Filmfare.
Thank you, Jury.

41
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,170
Thank you, Meena.

42
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:25,670
I'd like to thank all my colleagues.

43
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,087
Kaka..

44
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:30,254
Amit..

45
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:32,170
Dharam..

46
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,668
Sanjeev..

47
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,712
..Shammi, Shashi, Rajji..

48
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,170
Thank you very much.
And better luck next time.

49
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:43,504
There's a person in my life.

50
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:46,862
Actually, the only person who's
really, really important to me.

51
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,754
I'd like to thank my little..

52
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:53,004
Someone's cell phone seems to be
ringing near the console.

53
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:54,795
Could you please switch it off?

54
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,004
Oh, sorry.

55
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,004
Sorry.

56
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,545
Vikas. Secretary.

57
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,134
Yes, tell me, Vikas. - There's a
mind-blowing role in 'Bajirao Mastani'.

58
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:07,457
Bajirao's?
- No, his friend's.

59
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:10,674
So will I carry Bajirao's palanquin
in the whole film?

60
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:14,337
I've told you so many times, no
side roles. I do only main leads.

61
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,504
Sorry, guys.

62
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,337
Yes, I was saying my
little uncle and..

63
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:23,379
Excuse me. Embarrassing.

64
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,920
Uncle. Uncle,
I was just talking about you.

65
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:30,670
Uncle, could you call me back in
two minutes? I'm giving a speech.

66
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,462
I've called many times.
Are you still dreaming?

67
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:36,045
Uncle.

68
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,045
Dream?

69
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:47,787
Yes, Uncle?
- Come to my office immediately.

70
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,504
Come. I have an urgent problem
to talk with you about.

71
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,337
Uncle, I'll be right there.

72
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:01,695
Suhan! My hero! My superstar!

73
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:04,504
Uncle, basket.

74
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:11,004
Uncle, what is the trouble that
you woke me up early in the morning?

75
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:13,254
It was that kind of situation.

76
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,424
Give it to me.

77
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,457
Sorry! Sorry!
- What were you trying to do?

78
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:21,837
Sorry, Uncle. I was trying
to help you. I won't do it.

79
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,391
You want to help me
because I'm a dwarf?

80
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:27,299
No, uncle! - So.. - Tell me.
From where do you look like a dwarf?

81
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:31,236
Exactly. You are my true friend.
- I know.

82
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:35,275
Are you the new assistant?
- Yes, sir. Pandey.

83
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:40,879
Mr. Pandey, henceforth knock
before entering my office.

84
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:42,962
Sorry, Mr. Bowney
('dwarf' in Hindi).

85
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:45,712
What did you say?
- Mr. Bowney.

86
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:49,709
It's not Mr. Bowney.
It's Boney!

87
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:51,462
I don't know why my parents
kept my name such..

88
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,236
..that it suits my personality.

89
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:56,333
Bowney.
- Boney!

90
00:07:56,413 --> 00:07:58,374
Bo..
- Okay. You can call me sir.

91
00:07:58,454 --> 00:07:59,754
Sir, this..

92
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,060
Don't you sit down!
Stand up! Stand up!

93
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,337
Don't ever sit down in front of me.
- Sorry, sir.

94
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:06,295
Sir, this is
the bona fide certificate.

95
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,277
What certificate? - Sir, bowna
('dwarf' in Hindi) fide certificate.

96
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:13,440
It's not bowna fide.
It's bona fide certificate.

97
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,694
Even I can see that.
But whose are they?

98
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:17,107
Mr. Banerjee.

99
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:26,277
Mr. Pandey..are you
doing this deliberately?

100
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:27,899
What, sir?

101
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:30,107
Because you know that I..

102
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,565
Sir, you what?

103
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,945
Because I'm..because I'm..
- You?

104
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:36,607
Because I'm a dwarf.

105
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:40,044
Sir, how could you even think this?!
Sir, I can't even imagine this!

106
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:43,436
Okay! Okay! Relax!
Don't get emotional.

107
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,202
Give me a pen.

108
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,202
Boney Singh. Okay.

109
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,994
Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

110
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,119
Sir..

111
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,119
Yes, Mr. Pandey.

112
00:08:58,202 --> 00:09:01,221
Sir, today I need a half-day leave.
- Of course! Of course!

113
00:09:02,036 --> 00:09:03,244
Why do you need a leave?

114
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:06,244
Sir, my car has broken down.
Its bonnet has broken.

115
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,327
Bonnet?

116
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:13,577
Get out! Get out! Bonnet?

117
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:19,328
No need to hide your laughter, son.

118
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:21,457
Very soon these tears of happiness..

119
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,702
..are going to become
tears of sorrow.

120
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:25,911
No!

121
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:30,307
A notice had come today
in the morning.

122
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:35,552
From Piya's lawyer.

123
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,497
A year ago, Mr. Suhan Kapoor
and Ms. Piya Goyal had divorced.

124
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:45,747
The court had declared
that every month on the 1st..

125
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:51,437
..the husband, Suhan Kapoor,
will send a cheque of Rs.25,000..

126
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:53,664
..as alimony to his wife Piya Goyal.

127
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:56,745
But even after a year, Suhan Kapoor..

128
00:09:56,825 --> 00:10:01,286
..has not sent even one
cheque of alimony to Piya Goyal.

129
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,613
Because of Suhan Kapoor's
carelessness, Piya Goyal..

130
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:08,988
..had to undergo tremendous financial,
physical and mental stress.

131
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,822
Because it has been proved
that Piya Goyal..

132
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,905
..can't depend on
Suhan Kapoor every month..

133
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:20,697
..Piya Goyal demands
a one-time settlement..

134
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:25,307
..of Rs.5 million as an alimony
from Suhan Kapoor.

135
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,363
Rs.5 million!

136
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:33,735
You have one month's time
to repay the settlement amount.

137
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,985
Suhan! Suhan! Suhan!

138
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,527
Superstar, catch the ball!

139
00:10:58,187 --> 00:10:59,485
Watch out!

140
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:01,235
Uncle!

141
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:04,093
I had heard that poison
is used to treat poison.

142
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:08,267
But shock being used to treat shock
I'm seeing for the first time.

143
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:11,674
Rs.5 million! Uncle,
from where will I get Rs.5 million?

144
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,281
I don't have enough money to even pay
the telephone and electricity bill.

145
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:16,305
I have not paid my house rent
for the past three months.

146
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,144
This is of no interest to the law.

147
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,629
The law had decided the amount.

148
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,754
And you have not paid
a single penny to Piya.

149
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:25,098
But Uncle, Piya doesn't need money.

150
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:27,539
I don't have work.
She should be giving me the alimony.

151
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:30,257
But when you got divorced,
at that time you had work..

152
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:31,463
..and Piya had no work. Cheers!

153
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,337
Correct! Correct!

154
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:35,840
But now the tables have turned.

155
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,674
She has work. That too in New York.

156
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:40,674
She is earning in dollars.
Uncle, I have no work.

157
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:43,882
So we have to go to court,
and re-evaluate this case.

158
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,899
And you'll have to get me alimony.
Correct?

159
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:48,337
Really? How much?

160
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:50,295
I think Rs.50,000 per month is fine.

161
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,170
Rs.50,000! I'll throttle you!

162
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,629
Why? You didn't like my idea?

163
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,212
Not at all! At least sometimes
take your work seriously.

164
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:58,712
This is a court case.

165
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:00,299
You have not given a single penny..

166
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,004
..to Piya in the past
one year as alimony.

167
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,754
If you go to the court,
then you yourself will get stuck.

168
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,362
Uncle, what should I do?
I don't get any work.

169
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:12,295
Whatever money I had, I spent that
on bodybuilding and the photo session.

170
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:14,420
Where will I get Rs.5 million?

171
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,295
Son, you'll have to arrange
for the money.

172
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:18,629
Otherwise,
you'll have to rot in prison.

173
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:23,170
I won't go to prison.

174
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:24,920
If I went to prison..

175
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:29,476
..then my dream of becoming a
superstar would be totally shattered.

176
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:31,045
I'll somehow survive.
But you won't.

177
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:32,256
Think of a way out, Uncle.
- I should?

178
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:36,129
I'll think of a brilliant idea.

179
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,712
I could have never imagined!

180
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:40,754
I could have never imagined that
Piya would behave like this!

181
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:43,288
I don't know what I've done that
she is taking revenge on me!

182
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:45,837
She wants to send me to prison.

183
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,462
What is this?
- I'm showing you the flashback..

184
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,882
..so that you'll get
a rough idea about my life.

185
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:54,920
People who live for love are lucky.

186
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:59,379
People who die for love are strange.

187
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:03,425
Our saga is precious, my love.

188
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:08,273
We are away and yet we are near.

189
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,795
"I know.."

190
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:23,462
"Love is naive."

191
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:31,754
"The heart tends to make mistakes."

192
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:39,212
"Love is oblivious to patience."

193
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,045
"I know that love is naive."

194
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:04,125
"The heart tends to make mistakes."

195
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:09,250
"Love is oblivious to patience."

196
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:16,375
"I know that love is naive."

197
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:22,064
"The heart tends to make mistakes."

198
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:28,045
"Love is oblivious to patience."

199
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,542
"My love."

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,583
"My love."

201
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,875
"My love."

202
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:06,777
"My love."

203
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,712
If you had not given me
the idiotic idea..

204
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,795
..of eloping with Piya that night..

205
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,500
..then today my plight
wouldn't have been this.

206
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,292
I couldn't bear your plight then.

207
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,917
How was I to know that Piya
would turn out to be like this?

208
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,708
She looked so innocent.

209
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:29,503
"What happened was
the norm of society."

210
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,958
"Mom didn't agree."

211
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,417
"Dad was angry."

212
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:43,295
"That was the start of my downfall."

213
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,920
"This was the only style of love."

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,170
"They didn't agree."

215
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,458
"And we became rebels."

216
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:57,250
"We were fervent, and we escaped."

217
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:54,333
"I know that love is naive."

218
00:16:54,417 --> 00:17:00,167
"The heart..
- Tends to make mistakes."

219
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:05,417
"Love is oblivious to patience."

220
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,087
My hero? No, no.
It's just a rumour.

221
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,875
Sir. Sir, did you call me?

222
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,542
I'll call you back.

223
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,542
My PRO said that you are married.

224
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,708
Yes, sir. Piya sir. The girl who had
come to the office with me.

225
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,833
Sir, she's my wife. Piya.

226
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:24,250
Your wife?

227
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,628
If the public comes to know
that my hero is a married man..

228
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,167
..then who will come
to watch my movie?

229
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,958
I'll lose millions.

230
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,887
If I knew you were married,
I would never have signed you on.

231
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,958
But now, you have to hide the fact
that you're married.

232
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:39,878
You have to stay away from your
wife till the film is released.

233
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:41,743
Okay, sir.

234
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,167
Are we going somewhere?

235
00:18:51,637 --> 00:18:56,253
"I'm worried about
this helplessness."

236
00:18:56,333 --> 00:19:00,750
"You'll be sad to know it.
But I'm with you."

237
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,337
"I'll have to stay away from you."

238
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:09,878
"It's a matter of only a couple
of months. Please endure it."

239
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:14,462
"My future, I swear on you."

240
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:19,045
"My future hinges on this, Piya."

241
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:23,837
"I know that love is naive."

242
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:29,708
"The heart tends to make mistakes."

243
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:35,417
"Love is oblivious to patience."

244
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,625
You have no idea what you're doing.
Idiot.

245
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:23,500
Silly. Nonsensical.

246
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,875
You are simply hopeless.
- I got a headache due to this film.

247
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,750
This film has ruined me.

248
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,122
It was my mistake that I invested
money on you. You are a super flop!

249
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:57,708
"When I returned defeated.."

250
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,417
"..back to my home.."

251
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:06,792
"..Piya had already left."

252
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,378
"She didn't even answer my call."

253
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,875
"I wrote her letters
throughout the year."

254
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:21,545
"But my voice didn't reach her."

255
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:26,126
"My Piya got lost somewhere."

256
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:35,125
"I was hopeful that some day
she too would call me."

257
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:35,545
"I know that love is naive."

258
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:41,458
"The heart tends to make mistakes."

259
00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:46,833
"Love is oblivious to patience."

260
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,958
The table is a bit far.

261
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,875
Your story is very sad.
It's very emotional.

262
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:11,667
Even today, I don't understand
why she did this to me.

263
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:17,458
She ditched me when
I needed her the most.

264
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,882
Women are like that.
- Correct.

265
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:25,962
You can never trust them.
- Correct.

266
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:31,208
If you have wealth and fame,
then women will hover around you.

267
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:36,003
And when you are in trouble,
they'll leave you in the lurch.

268
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,625
What are you doing?

269
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,292
I understand all these things.

270
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,079
There is only one thing that my
business mind can't figure out.

271
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:46,625
From where will I get Rs.5 million?

272
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:51,166
Friend, don't worry about that.
Don't worry about that.

273
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,667
Because the one
who has given hunger..

274
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:56,458
..will also provide you with food.

275
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:58,420
Because the one
who has given thirst..

276
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,962
..will provide you with alcohol too.

277
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:02,028
And the one who has given alcohol,
he'll give snacks as well.

278
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,362
The one who has given trouble
will also find a solution.

279
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:08,279
We'll surely find a scapegoat
from whom we'll get Rs.5 million.

280
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,437
What scapegoat, Uncle?

281
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:13,285
What scapegoat?
A scapegoat that has Rs.5 million.

282
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:17,371
A foolish man who is willing
to give us Rs.5 million.

283
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:20,080
A fool who'll dance to our tunes.

284
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,826
A fool who'll listen to
everything that we say.

285
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:25,871
A fool who'll do whatever we say.

286
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:32,118
But where will we find such a fool?

287
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,596
Excuse me.
Behind..the street behind.

288
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:45,413
Listen to me. Sell this house.

289
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:46,951
This house doesn't belong to me.

290
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:49,743
I'm a tenant. And for the past
three months, I haven't paid rent.

291
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:51,424
How much will you get
for your old car?

292
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:53,660
I already sold it three months
back for Rs.50,000.

293
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,470
You have no integrity to sell.
Do you have anything to sell?

294
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:00,868
Uncle.
- Yes.

295
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:04,213
How much will I get for my kidney?

296
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:05,743
Don't talk rubbish.

297
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:16,115
The one who has nobody
has God with him.

298
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:20,755
I don't say that.
It's written in the books.

299
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:23,740
Now only God can save us.

300
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,615
Let's ask for God's help.

301
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:28,406
Help.

302
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:29,705
Yes.

303
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:31,195
Help.

304
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:35,528
We don't have any other option.
- He is right.

305
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:38,370
It's the first time
I'm asking you for something.

306
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,778
There's no other way.

307
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:44,153
Please God, send an angel
who will solve all our problems.

308
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:45,778
Please!

309
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:55,111
Let's see who has come.

310
00:25:57,611 --> 00:25:58,903
Hi, guys.

311
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:00,861
Hi.
- Hi.

312
00:26:04,653 --> 00:26:05,677
Angel!

313
00:26:05,757 --> 00:26:08,740
Like this, I entered
Suhan's life as an angel.

314
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,352
What are you looking for?
- What are you looking for?

315
00:26:15,404 --> 00:26:17,820
Piya.
- Piya? Piya!

316
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:20,153
Piya doesn't stay here.
- Piya doesn't stay here.

317
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:23,930
But the address is of this house.

318
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,990
Have a look.
- Get me that letter.

319
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,903
Please help the child.
- I'm not a child.

320
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:30,903
I'm not a child.
- Sorry, Uncle.

321
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,615
She doesn't stay here.
She got a divorce.

322
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:36,861
Divorce.

323
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,236
I knew it's not going to work,
it's not going to work.

324
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:44,903
How could Piya have remained
with that guy?

325
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,545
Piya is an angel,
and that man is a beast.

326
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,320
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have let her go.

327
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,191
I should have been with her.

328
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,695
God, I don't know in
what condition she's in.

329
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,611
What? - Your praise
('who are you' in Urdu)?

330
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:01,031
Is this a time for praise?

331
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:04,111
Let us ask in English.

332
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:05,486
How are you?
- Oh.

333
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:08,656
Who are you?
- You mean...

334
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:11,945
Actually, sorry, I've been in
the U.S. for the past seven years.

335
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:14,781
And so my Hindi is not that..
it's a little bit..you know..

336
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:16,586
Yes, we understand.

337
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,889
Anyways, I'm Agastya Rao..
- And I myself am..

338
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:21,786
..from NASA, Houston, Texas,
United States of America.

339
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:23,075
And your pin code?
- Zip code?

340
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:25,861
F5176721.

341
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,415
Hey, come on, guys. Be serious.
Be serious.

342
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:32,528
Be serious.
- Stop it. Please.

343
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,448
I'm sorry. After hearing
the news of Piya's divorce..

344
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:38,945
..I became a bit hyper.

345
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:40,736
Yes, we can understand.
- It happens.

346
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,365
Hey, guys, can you help me?
Let me know where she stays?

347
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:48,031
Her contact number, address,
e-mail, anything..

348
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:50,445
She's gone.
- She's gone. Gone far away.

349
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:52,361
Where has she gone?

350
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:54,153
She's gone far away.
- How far?

351
00:27:54,236 --> 00:27:55,611
New York.
- New York.

352
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:00,450
New York!
- Yes, New York!

353
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:09,406
After seven years, I gathered
my courage and came to meet Piya..

354
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:12,903
..and she is in New York?

355
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,383
Me and my plan to surprise her.

356
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,320
I should have called her up first
before coming here.

357
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,615
Listen..
- Yes?

358
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:28,611
This guy looks to me like a fraud,
not an angel.

359
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:30,195
Are you sure?
- Yes. Sure.

360
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:33,736
How do you know Piya?

361
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,365
You are?

362
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:39,070
My name is Suhan Kapoor.

363
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:40,778
Superstar!

364
00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:44,327
This means you are the new
owners of this house. - Oh, yes.

365
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:48,570
But you are asking me questions..

366
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:51,186
..as if you know Piya very well.

367
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:53,224
As if you are her relatives, could
be an elder brother. - And you?

368
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:58,023
From your words, it sounds like
you know Piya's family very well.

369
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,820
Yes.
- Please explain.

370
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,401
No, I don't know Piya's family,
but I know Piya very well.

371
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:06,257
She was my girlfriend.
- What?

372
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:07,866
Yes, she was my sweetheart.
- What?

373
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,126
But, Piya's marriage was
going to be with someone else..

374
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,570
Yes.
- I mean..

375
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:14,855
What did I tell you?
- I don't know.

376
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,120
She was my girlfriend,
but I wasn't her boyfriend.

377
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,153
Oh.
- What are you trying to say?

378
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:21,570
I can understand.

379
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:25,581
Actually, Piya was to marry me.

380
00:29:26,172 --> 00:29:27,460
Oh.

381
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,820
But she married that
bull and ruined her life.

382
00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:34,361
Have you seen him?
He looked like King Kong.

383
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:38,265
I already knew that Piya could
never be happy with that gorilla.

384
00:29:39,053 --> 52
She was a delicate doll,
and the guy was a hairy bear!

385
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:45,212
But you haven't yet told us,
how did you know her?

386
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:47,816
How did I know her?

387
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:54,861
Actually, we studied
in the same college.

388
00:29:55,614 --> 00:29:57,570
She was the love of my life..

389
00:29:58,689 --> 00:30:00,070
..my sweetheart.

390
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,778
Whose photo is this?

391
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,403
This is me and Piya.

392
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:10,972
That is the only copy I have.
Please handle it carefully.

393
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:13,153
I'll..

394
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,861
That was the last time I saw Piya.

395
00:30:18,346 --> 00:30:19,903
She was very happy.

396
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:26,543
I don't know what condition
she is in now.

397
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,004
No, son, don't say it like that.

398
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:30,501
Uncle..
- Be quiet.

399
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:35,822
So you were saying how
Piya was to marry you.

400
00:30:36,577 --> 00:30:37,501
Yes.

401
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:44,927
It's a long story.
It'll take a lot of time.

402
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:47,760
Don't worry about time.
We have enough.

403
00:30:47,844 --> 00:30:49,927
What do you say?
- Yes.

404
00:30:50,675 --> 00:30:54,302
I still remember vividly..
my first day in college.

405
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:56,677
Come.

406
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,552
See my college.
Excuse me.

407
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:00,760
Please clear the frame.

408
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,574
E = mc2. I don't know how
that genius cracked it.

409
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:09,594
It's amazing. Einstein, genius.
- Einstein.

410
00:31:09,674 --> 00:31:11,344
What's the time?
- 3:30 pm.

411
00:31:11,424 --> 00:31:13,594
Okay, okay, I'm going, bye.
- Bye.

412
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:15,219
Bye.

413
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:17,941
Champu!

414
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,469
Hey!

415
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,760
Sorry.

416
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:45,996
No problem.

417
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:15,010
Champu!
- Love at first sight.

418
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:19,052
I remember.
The first day of the college.

419
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:28,477
The first day of the college.
My foot!

420
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:36,469
Sorry dude.

421
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,135
What happened then?

422
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,344
Time passed, and we came closer.

423
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,594
Piya and I were like one.

424
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,246
Whatever class, chemistry, physics..

425
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,139
..we sat together.
- Really?

426
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:53,376
Then one day..

427
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:58,302
'Find the velocity of sound
at 20 degree centigrade in water.'

428
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:03,805
Whereas, zero degree
centigrade the velocity is 1133..

429
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:05,219
..speed per second.

430
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:07,594
Yes, sure. Sure.

431
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:11,947
Excuse me.

432
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:14,297
Excuse me.

433
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:16,754
Who are you? What do you want?

434
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:19,802
Me, Agastya Rao. Your neighbour.

435
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:21,260
I always sit here.

436
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,760
Really? I never saw you before.

437
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:26,719
But I have always seen you.
- What?

438
00:33:27,677 --> 00:33:30,781
Your sister. She's calling you.
She's waiting outside.

439
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:41,385
Come here. Please help me.
- No. No. No. No.

440
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:49,594
Please..
- Okay, okay.

441
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:53,180
Sir. I have one question, sir.
- Yes?

442
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,135
Nucleus of an alpha particle with
velocity of 5.95 into 10 raised to..

443
00:33:57,219 --> 00:33:58,677
..the power of 6, sir.

444
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,302
Can you tell me the velocity of
the equal of the nucleus, sir?

445
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:04,062
Very good question, Agastya.

446
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,260
Go, go. Go.

447
00:34:10,512 --> 00:34:11,927
Yes, come in.

448
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:14,679
You dropped your book.

449
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:18,802
Agastya! What are you doing?

450
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:24,594
Me..

451
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:31,543
And for the first time, I remember..

452
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:34,944
..I sacrificed for Piya.

453
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,666
Come on.

454
00:34:39,802 --> 00:34:41,434
"Spread the net."
- "Fly away."

455
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,801
"Fly away. Fly away. Fly away."

456
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,094
Yo!

457
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:51,014
Hi, baby!

458
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,469
I'm performing in your college
tomorrow night. - Yes!

459
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,265
Who will you come with?

460
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:02,302
Somebody has to accompany me.
- Nonsense.

461
00:35:02,385 --> 00:35:03,561
You know I've
a psychological problem.

462
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:07,719
I can't see you with another man.
- Suhan, please.

463
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:09,469
It's a rock concert.
How can I go alone?

464
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:11,677
Darn it!

465
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,594
Don't get jealous.

466
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:15,760
Okay, listen to me.
- What?

467
00:35:15,844 --> 00:35:18,389
I'll come with whichever
guy you suggest.

468
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:19,719
Really?

469
00:35:21,427 --> 00:35:22,719
Come with him.

470
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:26,597
Yes. Yes way!
- No!

471
00:35:26,677 --> 00:35:28,427
Yes way!

472
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:31,398
This Champu has already gotten
a thrashing because of you.

473
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:36,427
There's no threat to me
from this fool. No threat to me.

474
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,110
Suhan! Okay. Okay.

475
00:35:42,395 --> 00:35:43,385
Love you.

476
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:45,808
Even today,
when I think of that day..

477
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:49,555
..my ears start ringing.
- Ofcourse.

478
00:35:49,978 --> 00:35:52,385
My sacrifice wasn't wasted.

479
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:57,097
I was sitting alone
on the steps and thinking..

480
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:58,552
Hi, Champu.

481
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:01,618
Oh, my God! Are you crying?

482
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,219
No.

483
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,844
There was something in my eye.

484
00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:09,052
Take this.
- What's this?

485
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:11,427
I'm so sorry.
It was because of me..

486
00:36:13,302 --> 00:36:15,396
No. Not because of you.

487
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:18,411
Don't be sorry. We are friends.

488
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,921
And in friendship,
you never say sorry or thank you.

489
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,264
Friends are friends. Okay?

490
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:26,885
Oh, Champu, you are so sweet.

491
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,219
Don't cry.

492
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,597
Okay, listen.

493
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:36,260
Will you come to the rock-show
along with me as my date?

494
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:45,677
I would love to.
I would love to come.

495
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:50,677
Champu, you are late. - I'm sorry.
I had gone to buy a new suit.

496
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,260
How do I look?
- Wow!

497
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:53,802
At least look at it once.

498
00:36:53,885 --> 00:36:55,344
Come on. Come on.

499
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:02,594
Friends, get set to rock.
It's the superstar!

500
00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:07,764
"Say hey-o."

501
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:09,594
"Hey-o."

502
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:11,506
"Hey-o."

503
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:13,472
"Hey-o."

504
00:37:13,552 --> 00:37:16,124
"We love you!"
- I can't hear you.

505
00:37:16,388 --> 00:37:18,271
"We love you!"
- Louder!

506
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:21,885
"We love you!
- Yes!"

507
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:24,469
"I love you, too.
- Yeah."

508
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:36,444
"Colour it!"
- "Fly away."

509
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:38,427
"Beat the drum"
- "Fly away."

510
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,385
"Spread the net."
- "Fly away."

511
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:42,264
"Fly away."

512
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,222
"Colour it, fly away, fly away."

513
00:37:44,302 --> 00:37:46,139
"Beat the drum. Fly away."

514
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:48,005
"Spread the net.
Fly away."

515
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:50,177
"Fly away, fly away."

516
00:37:58,888 --> 00:38:06,514
"This love of mine is not new."

517
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:12,885
"Then why am I flying?"

518
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:18,761
"I was as colourful
as the butterfly."

519
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:22,579
"I started to fly."

520
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:28,760
"If someone is with you,
then fly away."

521
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:32,177
"Colour it, fly away, fly away."

522
00:38:32,257 --> 00:38:34,066
"Beat the drums.
- Fly away."

523
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,021
"Spread the net, fly away."

524
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,021
"Fly away."

525
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,733
"Yes, this is the conflict."

526
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:49,822
"A fight in style."

527
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:33,521
"Look! Cho Chweet."

528
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:40,629
"I could read the lines
of someone's palm."

529
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:48,577
"If someone wished,
I would treat him."

530
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:52,441
"Listen to what your heart says."

531
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:55,913
"And then fly away."

532
00:39:55,993 --> 00:40:03,618
"This love of mine isn't new."

533
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:10,065
"Then why am I flying?"

534
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:15,815
"When fire burns,
it does not extinguish."

535
00:40:15,895 --> 00:40:19,622
"On this heart,
it comes and settles."

536
00:40:19,702 --> 00:40:23,497
"Love, if you find it,
then fly away."

537
00:40:23,577 --> 00:40:26,490
"Fly away."

538
00:40:27,368 --> 00:40:29,288
"Colour it, fly away, fly away."

539
00:40:29,368 --> 00:40:31,160
"Beat the drums. Fly away."

540
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:33,122
"Spread the net, fly away."

541
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:35,038
"Fly away."

542
00:40:35,118 --> 00:40:36,955
"Colour it, fly away, fly away."

543
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,872
"Beat the drums, fly away."

544
00:40:38,952 --> 00:40:40,785
"Spread the net, fly away."

545
00:40:40,868 --> 00:40:42,952
"Fly away, fly away, fly away."

546
00:40:44,785 --> 00:40:47,142
"Put your hands together!"

547
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,952
"Do you want more?"

548
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:49,743
Oh god! How sad!

549
00:41:51,202 --> 00:41:54,743
Sorry. After listening
to such a sad story..

550
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,910
..my eyes are moist.
My throat is dry as well.

551
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:00,743
I'll go and get tea.

552
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,971
Shall I get something for you,
Champu?

553
00:42:04,785 --> 00:42:05,993
I'm sorry.

554
00:42:06,602 --> 00:42:08,924
I entered your character.

555
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:11,176
Shall I get something for you,
Agastya?

556
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:15,160
Yes, I'll just have a..Bourn..vita.

557
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:18,413
It's not Bourn and then Vita.
It's together. Bournvita.

558
00:42:18,493 --> 00:42:19,660
Okay?
- Okay!

559
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,790
And you..follow me.

560
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:28,577
What are you looking for, Uncle?
A recipe for vita?

561
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:29,868
Shut up!

562
00:42:31,618 --> 00:42:32,993
Found it!

563
00:42:38,554 --> 00:42:40,080
What did you find,
Uncle, Rs.5 million?

564
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,243
I didn't find Rs.5 million,
but an idea to obtain it.

565
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,618
Piya will pay me?
- No. Now listen carefully.

566
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:54,670
Section 25,
under the Hindu Marriage Act..

567
00:42:55,162 --> 00:42:59,705
After divorce, a husband has to
take care of his wife's expenses..

568
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,814
..until she remarries.

569
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:05,440
Once your ex-wife remarries..

570
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:08,810
..her responsibility
passes to her new husband.

571
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:14,035
And you need not give
money towards expenses.

572
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,372
This means if Piya
gets married to Champu..

573
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:25,868
..then we'll get Rs.5 million?

574
00:43:26,764 --> 00:43:29,714
No, Uncle. I'm not going along
with your lousy ideas this time.

575
00:43:30,577 --> 00:43:32,642
As you wish.

576
00:43:33,035 --> 00:43:34,627
I was trying to help you.

577
00:43:34,952 --> 00:43:37,122
As a friend and a lawyer..

578
00:43:37,202 --> 00:43:38,827
..I was doing my duty.

579
00:43:39,118 --> 00:43:40,614
Now it's your decision.

580
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:51,118
There's no other way, Uncle?
- No.

581
00:43:53,737 --> 00:43:56,129
So what do you say?

582
00:43:58,232 --> 00:44:00,000
What do you say, sir?

583
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:06,690
I was thinking, we won't find
a better suitor for our Piya.

584
00:44:07,842 --> 00:44:10,438
So we should find
an auspicious time..

585
00:44:10,785 --> 00:44:13,403
..and get both of them married.

586
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:19,321
I think we should ask
Piya what she wants.

587
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:21,243
It would be best.

588
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,989
Here, son. Bournvita for you.
- Thank you.

589
00:44:29,285 --> 00:44:33,743
So son, what have you thought?
What will you do in life? What?

590
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:37,077
Nothing, Uncle.
I'm thinking of going back home.

591
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,913
But you know,
I'm worried about Piya.

592
00:44:39,993 --> 00:44:41,625
I don't know what condition
she may be in.

593
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:45,785
Look son, whatever happens
in life is for the best.

594
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:49,618
Had everything been all right
in Piya's life..

595
00:44:49,827 --> 00:44:52,952
..today you would be having
Bournvita with her husband here.

596
00:44:53,035 --> 00:44:53,410
Correct.

597
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:57,243
You wouldn't be having Bournvita
with me and him in this balcony.

598
00:44:58,202 --> 00:45:00,785
What?
- He hasn't got it. I'll explain.

599
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:05,077
Son, you are having Bournvita
with us here..

600
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,202
..because Piya has separated
from her husband.

601
00:45:08,364 --> 00:45:09,577
He still hasn't got it.

602
00:45:10,202 --> 00:45:11,535
One second, Uncle.

603
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,038
Are you telling me
about Piya or Bournvita?

604
00:45:14,118 --> 00:45:16,330
Hey, shut up, shut up.

605
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,660
You haven't understood.
I'll explain it to you.

606
00:45:17,743 --> 00:45:21,077
You..I'll tell you.

607
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:22,535
Piya has got a divorce.

608
00:45:22,618 --> 00:45:24,077
Yeah.
- Piya has got a divorce.

609
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,535
That means she doesn't
stay with her husband.

610
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:28,372
That means she is alone once again.

611
00:45:28,452 --> 00:45:32,353
You have come here after seven years,
across the ocean. Why?

612
00:45:33,202 --> 00:45:34,952
To have Bournvita.
- You..

613
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:36,940
You haven't come for Bournvita!

614
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:40,577
You came because you are
destined to be with Piya..

615
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,577
..and Piya is destined
to be with you.

616
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,285
You're made for each other.

617
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,243
Made for each other.
- Yes.

618
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:49,077
Really?
- Yes.

619
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,618
She is only yours, only yours.

620
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:53,077
Only yours.

621
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,258
What are you doing?
She's mine?

622
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:57,785
Yes, she's yours.

623
00:45:57,868 --> 00:46:00,080
Your name is in her destiny.

624
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,743
Otherwise, why would she
have gotten a divorce? - Why?

625
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:04,519
Why would you come here
after seven years? - Why?

626
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,452
Yes, that makes sense.
- Of course, that makes sense.

627
00:46:08,535 --> 00:46:11,160
Why are you here having
Bournvita with us? - Why?

628
00:46:11,243 --> 00:46:12,913
Here is her address..

629
00:46:12,993 --> 00:46:15,580
..that she had sent for forwarding
her letters, et cetera.

630
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,614
Take a flight to New York and in
22 hours, Piya will be in your arms.

631
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:30,139
One second. But..

632
00:46:30,743 --> 00:46:33,579
What will I do there?
- Do we have to explain it to you?

633
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,233
Yes, we do.
- Do we?

634
00:46:35,313 --> 00:46:36,872
You too...
- Okay.

635
00:46:36,952 --> 00:46:40,535
I'll tell you. This is magic. See.

636
00:46:40,993 --> 00:46:43,202
"It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know."

637
00:46:43,285 --> 00:46:44,543
"The world.."

638
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,442
Please, come in..

639
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:06,360
Hi..hi..

640
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:11,285
Please come and sit here.

641
00:47:11,648 --> 00:47:13,702
What are you doing here?

642
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:16,957
Who will play the music?
Your father?

643
00:47:41,799 --> 00:47:44,215
"It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know."

644
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:46,674
"The whole world knows,
only Piya doesn't know."

645
00:47:46,757 --> 00:47:49,215
"It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know."

646
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,799
"The whole world knows,
only Piya doesn't know."

647
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:54,382
"The heart knows the lover."

648
00:47:54,465 --> 00:47:56,882
"The heart knows the lover."

649
00:47:56,962 --> 00:47:59,090
"But Piya doesn't know the heart."

650
00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:01,552
"It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know."

651
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:04,257
"The whole world knows,
only Piya doesn't know."

652
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:45,010
"In broken poetry,
I have written in a diary."

653
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:50,174
"You are the last rain,
you are the last request."

654
00:48:54,924 --> 00:48:59,882
"In broken poetry,
I have written in a diary."

655
00:48:59,965 --> 00:49:04,635
"You are the last rain,
you are the last request."

656
00:49:04,715 --> 00:49:07,344
"Why don't you understand.."

657
00:49:07,424 --> 00:49:09,802
"..the heart is a deep well."

658
00:49:09,882 --> 00:49:12,219
"A fire burns every time."

659
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:14,760
"There is smoke everywhere."

660
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,260
"Leap, you'll get Piya."

661
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,674
"Move a little,
the world will move too."

662
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:24,007
"Die and fall in love."

663
00:49:27,424 --> 00:49:30,382
What are you doing, Uncle?
The song is so good.

664
00:49:30,465 --> 00:49:34,094
You fool. If you play just one song,
the audience will get bored.

665
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:37,299
"The whole world knows.
Only Piya doesn't know."

666
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:02,465
"Oh yeah."

667
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:19,049
"Show some charm of yours.."

668
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:21,424
"..If you love Piya."

669
00:50:21,504 --> 00:50:23,882
"Let life be lost, if it does.."

670
00:50:23,962 --> 00:50:26,558
"..It's a small risk."

671
00:50:31,382 --> 00:50:33,808
"Show some charm of yours.."

672
00:50:33,888 --> 00:50:36,260
"..If you love Piya."

673
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,673
"Let life be lost, if it does.."

674
00:50:38,753 --> 00:50:41,260
"..It's a small risk."

675
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,802
"If you cut it with your nail.."

676
00:50:43,882 --> 00:50:46,177
"..even the diamond will be cut."

677
00:50:46,257 --> 00:50:48,802
"If you even look at it.."

678
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:51,184
"..the bulb will explode."

679
00:50:51,264 --> 00:50:53,594
"The system of love is the same."

680
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:56,010
"Your beloved is the same."

681
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:00,382
If she isn't there..

682
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,677
"The heart knows the lover."

683
00:51:09,757 --> 00:51:12,299
"The heart knows the lover."

684
00:51:12,382 --> 00:51:14,424
"But Piya doesn't know the heart."

685
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,927
"It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know."

686
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,445
"The whole world knows.
Only Piya doesn't know."

687
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:21,885
"It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know."

688
00:51:21,965 --> 00:51:24,882
"The whole world knows.
Only Piya doesn't know."

689
00:51:46,674 --> 00:51:51,485
"It knows, it doesn't believe,
it believes, it doesn't know."

690
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:20,299
Hey, guys, thank you very much.
You've opened my eyes, you know.

691
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:23,549
You've made me feel that this could
happen between Piya and me as well.

692
00:52:23,632 --> 00:52:25,549
Leave it. Do you think it's yours?

693
00:52:25,632 --> 00:52:28,052
Excuse me.
They've taken my make-believe Piya.

694
00:52:28,132 --> 00:52:30,382
I'm going to New York to the real Piya.
- Congratulation!

695
00:52:30,462 --> 00:52:33,469
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

696
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:36,510
Hurry up! Come on, hurry up.

697
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:40,090
Hey, guys. Thank you.

698
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,635
Really, thank you very much.

699
00:52:41,715 --> 00:52:43,090
What is the need for that?
- That's right.

700
00:52:43,174 --> 00:52:45,090
This was our duty.
- We are friends.

701
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,840
Uncle. Bon..

702
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,177
Bon?
- Bon?

703
00:52:50,257 --> 00:52:51,260
Voyage.

704
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,177
Bon voyage.

705
00:52:52,257 --> 00:52:54,215
Okay, bon voyage. Bye.

706
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,924
Darn his bon voyage!

707
00:52:58,004 --> 00:52:59,799
Now there'll be some fun!

708
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:04,094
No chance. No chance.

709
00:53:04,174 --> 00:53:05,260
Uncle.

710
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,510
Do you think this Champu will be
able to impress Piya?

711
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:08,924
This Champu? Have you gone mad?

712
00:53:09,007 --> 00:53:10,632
You'll have to do it.

713
00:53:10,965 --> 00:53:12,299
No problem.

714
00:53:12,379 --> 00:53:14,882
But, Uncle, how will I
go to New York? - Yes!

715
00:53:17,982 --> 00:53:20,549
This is my lifelong saving.

716
00:53:20,882 --> 00:53:22,965
I had saved it for my wedding.

717
00:53:23,384 --> 00:53:25,840
Now it'll be used for your divorce.
Take it, son.

718
00:53:26,382 --> 00:53:28,549
Take it, son.
- I'll take it, Uncle.

719
00:53:29,393 --> 00:53:33,817
I promise, after my divorce,
I'll get you married.

720
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:38,760
No, no, this is not my flight.

721
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,132
I was here on the ground in a taxi.

722
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:45,090
Proceeding to New York
in search of Piya.

723
00:53:45,174 --> 00:53:48,469
What would I do there?
I didn't have any idea.

724
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:52,098
But no problem. Somebody else
is more concerned about that.

725
00:53:52,178 --> 00:53:54,882
Here's your boarding pass
and your passport.

726
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,257
Hi.
- Window or aisle?

727
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:03,914
Anything will do,
but Agastya Rao should be nearby.

728
00:54:10,215 --> 00:54:12,090
Hey, Suhan.

729
00:54:13,632 --> 00:54:15,007
Agastya.

730
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:19,669
Agastya Rao. Champu.

731
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,507
"Piya knows the heart.."
- Yes.

732
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,590
So after all,
you've taken my advice.

733
00:54:28,174 --> 00:54:29,507
You're going to New York?

734
00:54:31,049 --> 00:54:33,296
Yes. And what about you?
Where are you off to?

735
00:54:34,132 --> 00:54:35,627
I'm going to Ghatkopar.

736
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:37,049
Ghatkopar?

737
00:54:37,132 --> 00:54:39,059
Where is that?
- I'll get down at the next stop.

738
00:54:39,465 --> 00:54:40,965
Hey, stop.

739
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:43,715
Sure.

740
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:47,382
Excuse me.

741
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:50,424
Can I have one hot chocolate, please?
I need to relax before take-off.

742
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:53,385
Sorry, sir, there's no
service before take-off.

743
00:54:53,465 --> 00:54:54,799
You'll have to wait.
- Okay, alright.

744
00:54:54,879 --> 00:54:56,590
Excuse me, my dear,
could you find my..

745
00:54:56,674 --> 00:54:58,132
Here it is.

746
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,864
Well, thank you, my love.
Oh, my God, you smell good.

747
00:55:05,944 --> 00:55:09,465
Estee Lauder. Right? My favourite
perfume in the whole world.

748
00:55:09,549 --> 00:55:12,093
Sweetheart, just throw
this jacket somewhere. - Yes.

749
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:16,299
Yeah, and another thing.
Apple juice and wine.

750
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:18,257
There's no service
before take-off, sir.

751
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,549
But I'll see what I can do.

752
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:22,049
Oh, and hot chocolate
for this young man here.

753
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:23,340
Sure.
- Thank you.

754
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:25,340
He needs to relax himself.

755
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,799
Wow! How can you do it?
How can you do these things?

756
00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:32,590
Did you see that girl?

757
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,127
Had I been like you,
I would have been with Piya.

758
00:55:36,382 --> 00:55:41,090
I don't even know how to talk to girls.
I wish I was like you.

759
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:45,465
You mean, the flirting..
- Yes.

760
00:55:47,174 --> 00:55:49,802
It's my luck. I was born with it.

761
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:51,507
There's nothing I can do about it.

762
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:55,174
Cool. - Sir, Bournvita.

763
00:55:56,007 --> 00:55:56,757
Thank you.

764
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,590
And your apple juice.

765
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,590
It's quite hot.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

766
00:56:00,674 --> 00:56:03,139
And you know what? This is for you.

767
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:05,799
Want you to get back
as soon as you can.

768
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,793
Thanks.

769
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:10,090
Right. Right.

770
00:56:12,632 --> 00:56:16,001
I'm getting nervous. When I..

771
00:56:16,424 --> 00:56:18,507
..meet Piya tomorrow,
what will become of me?

772
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:25,713
I don't even know what
she likes or dislikes.

773
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:29,799
I hope I don't make
a fool out of myself.

774
00:56:29,882 --> 00:56:32,778
God has sent me
to solve your problem.

775
00:56:33,632 --> 00:56:35,757
If this is not a miracle, what is?

776
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:38,594
We are both going to New York
in the same flight.

777
00:56:38,674 --> 00:56:41,760
And not just that. We are seated
together as well. - Yes. I understand.

778
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:46,799
See. I promise you.
I'll help you out.

779
00:56:46,882 --> 00:56:49,215
Especially after hearing
that you are after her.

780
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:51,715
Really? - Really.

781
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:55,344
I have promised uncle that
until I get you married..

782
00:56:55,424 --> 00:57:00,549
..I won't catch
a flight back to Mumbai.

783
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:02,132
Promise.

784
00:57:02,671 --> 00:57:04,590
Our mission started like that.

785
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:08,090
And then began the biggest con
in the history of romance.

786
00:57:50,704 --> 00:57:52,387
Oh my god!

787
00:57:53,622 --> 00:57:56,705
I completely surrendered
myself to Suhan.

788
00:57:57,038 --> 00:57:58,663
Now, he was my godfather.

789
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:12,387
I'll just..
- Okay.

790
00:58:14,497 --> 00:58:17,683
Excuse me, sir, could you
help me with this address?

791
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,955
Oh, the sweet little girl next door.

792
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:23,830
Piya. - Piya.

793
00:58:23,913 --> 00:58:25,705
My neighbour.

794
00:58:25,913 --> 00:58:27,534
Look no further, young man.

795
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:29,830
She lives right up there
in her apartment. - Up there?

796
00:58:29,913 --> 00:58:31,838
The one with pink curtains?

797
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:34,247
But she's probably
sleeping right now.

798
00:58:35,622 --> 00:58:38,126
You must be the brother
she's been talking about.

799
00:58:38,622 --> 00:58:39,667
The brother?

800
00:58:40,788 --> 00:58:42,747
You must be the old man
she keeps talking about.

801
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,102
Probably.

802
00:58:44,747 --> 00:58:46,785
See you, sir. A pleasure.
- Bye.

803
00:58:51,663 --> 00:58:53,437
Hey, bro. What's up, guys?
- Yeah.

804
00:58:54,034 --> 00:59:07,205
"My love for you isn't new."

805
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:11,122
"But still why?"

806
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:15,209
Sorry.
Here's rent for a month.

807
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:19,205
What is this?
- Hey, guys, let's go!

808
00:59:19,285 --> 00:59:23,208
"I'll make a house
in front of your house."

809
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:25,250
"I'll make my world.."

810
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:27,163
"..in front of your house.."

811
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:33,375
"In my neighbouring window,
there's a radiant beauty."

812
00:59:33,455 --> 00:59:39,000
"It's regrettable that it is.."

813
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,498
Suhan, what are you looking at?
- You've forgotten the mission so soon.

814
00:59:41,997 --> 00:59:43,080
Oh, yes. Piya.

815
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:45,247
Show me. I want to see her.

816
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:46,955
She's probably sleeping.
- Okay.

817
00:59:47,038 --> 00:59:49,526
You keep watching.
Call me quickly when she wakes up.

818
01:00:10,626 --> 01:00:12,723
What happened?
What happened?

819
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:17,168
You were right. She has grown
so much in seven years.

820
01:00:18,668 --> 01:00:19,795
Behave yourself.
- Sorry.

821
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:21,126
Relax. - Sorry.
- Chill. - Sorry.

822
01:00:21,206 --> 01:00:22,460
Just hold.
- Right.

823
01:00:25,865 --> 01:00:27,029
Have you gone crazy?

824
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:29,251
She looks like Piya to you?
- Then who is she?

825
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:33,088
Please. Get the number of your
glasses checked, Mr. Agastya Rao.

826
01:00:33,168 --> 01:00:34,821
I'm an Indian, not Russian.
- What?

827
01:00:36,405 --> 01:00:37,876
Agastya. Agastya Rao.

828
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,543
Agastya. What?
- Agastya Rao.

829
01:00:41,626 --> 01:00:42,606
Sorry.

830
01:00:51,335 --> 01:00:53,338
Piya.
- Please

831
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:55,522
Can I see once, just once?

832
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,418
Please.

833
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:28,293
Agastya!

834
01:01:29,543 --> 01:01:30,751
What are you doing?

835
01:01:33,918 --> 01:01:36,043
What is this?
- I'm an astronaut.

836
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:38,043
Yes?
- And this is a telescope.

837
01:01:38,123 --> 01:01:40,043
The precursor of binoculars.

838
01:01:40,126 --> 01:01:42,793
I want to become an astronaut, too.
- Oh, why are you pushing me?

839
01:01:43,668 --> 01:01:45,335
Hold this.

840
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:47,418
Amazing.

841
01:01:48,222 --> 01:01:50,447
Wait.
Something will have to be done.

842
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:29,862
Suhan understood
I couldn't impress Piya.

843
01:02:30,425 --> 01:02:33,478
So he changed my personality
to be just like his.

844
01:03:09,846 --> 01:03:13,155
I'm looking just like you, right?
A Rock star.

845
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:16,555
No.

846
01:03:18,043 --> 01:03:19,471
Superstar.

847
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,388
What can I get for you gentlemen?

848
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:23,293
An apple juice and wine.

849
01:03:26,025 --> 01:03:27,876
Uncle!
- Uncle?

850
01:03:27,956 --> 01:03:30,626
Oh, I love you, Uncle!
- What are you doing?

851
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:32,960
Whose uncle am I?

852
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,064
Do you have a twin brother in India?
This small.

853
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,899
If I'm this size,
then how can my twin be that size?

854
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:44,368
I don't have a twin brother.
I'll ask my parents.

855
01:03:44,448 --> 01:03:46,710
Anyway, wine with apple juice.

856
01:03:48,585 --> 01:03:50,896
Did you see? Absolutely identical.

857
01:03:50,976 --> 01:03:52,835
He is uncle's carbon copy.

858
01:03:53,034 --> 01:03:55,501
How is it possible?
- Why can't it be possible?

859
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:58,268
Actually, it's claimed
there are at least..

860
01:03:58,348 --> 01:04:00,543
..seven people with any one face.

861
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:03,505
Nonsense.
- No, it isn't nonsense.

862
01:04:03,585 --> 01:04:05,061
It's a scientifically proven thing.

863
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,445
Really? - There are seven people
in the world with the same face.

864
01:04:07,525 --> 01:04:09,418
And..
- And?

865
01:04:10,578 --> 01:04:12,029
Just a minute.

866
01:04:12,918 --> 01:04:17,070
That means there must be six
other girls looking just like Piya.

867
01:04:17,624 --> 01:04:19,460
I think if I pursue them..

868
01:04:19,543 --> 01:04:21,143
..at least I'll get one of them.
What say?

869
01:04:21,819 --> 01:04:23,984
Do you love Piya's face or Piya?

870
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:25,251
Both.

871
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:29,210
Then forget all this nonsense
and concentrate on the mission.

872
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,707
Okay. Tell me.

873
01:04:30,787 --> 01:04:33,291
Today is the first day, so we'll
just do a warm-up today. - Okay.

874
01:04:33,371 --> 01:04:34,498
Do exactly as I tell you.

875
01:04:34,578 --> 01:04:36,583
Nothing more, nothing less.
- Fine.

876
01:04:36,663 --> 01:04:38,454
Otherwise,
the whole plan will be ruined.

877
01:04:38,537 --> 01:04:40,162
When Piya comes out
of her apartment..

878
01:04:42,204 --> 01:04:45,996
..react as if you've seen
her unexpectedly. All right?

879
01:04:47,162 --> 01:04:47,954
One moment.

880
01:04:48,037 --> 01:04:49,329
Just show me once more.

881
01:04:49,725 --> 01:04:51,746
Now I'll do it. Just look at me.

882
01:04:54,746 --> 01:04:56,954
You do superbly natural acting.
You should have been in Hollywood.

883
01:04:57,037 --> 01:04:59,162
Hey, come on, stop kidding.
- Listen.

884
01:04:59,735 --> 01:05:02,481
When she is walking ahead,
you'll call her by name.

885
01:05:02,561 --> 01:05:04,246
Like this..Piya!

886
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:05,704
P..Piya!
- Oh, my God!

887
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:07,381
You?
- Oh, my God! You?

888
01:05:07,461 --> 01:05:09,262
How Amazing!
- Here? Amazing!

889
01:05:09,342 --> 01:05:12,199
She'll turn back and look at you.
Her hair will fly at high speed.

890
01:05:20,122 --> 01:05:21,970
Go, my tiger.
My blessings are with you.

891
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:23,887
You remember everything, right?
- No.

892
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:27,221
What? - I forget everything
when I see Piya.

893
01:05:27,301 --> 01:05:28,955
Please come along with me.
- No!

894
01:05:29,483 --> 01:05:32,051
Why?
- Why? What do you mean, why?

895
01:05:32,131 --> 01:05:35,213
Why..why am I asking this question?
Why am I asking this question?

896
01:05:36,864 --> 01:05:38,324
Come on, let's go back home. Please.
- No, no.

897
01:05:38,404 --> 01:05:41,051
Listen, I'll come along with me.

898
01:05:41,131 --> 01:05:42,706
I'll be near you,
but I won't be with you.

899
01:05:42,786 --> 01:05:43,846
All right?
- Okay.

900
01:05:44,826 --> 01:05:46,804
Come on. Wait. What's this?

901
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:51,929
You use that as a radio-antenna?
- Thank you.

902
01:05:52,966 --> 01:05:55,179
Let's rock it, punk.

903
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:58,905
Rock the stone. Rock the stone.

904
01:05:58,985 --> 01:06:01,012
Okay. Let's go.

905
01:06:17,524 --> 01:06:19,222
You know what you've got to do,
right, Champu?

906
01:06:22,037 --> 01:06:23,346
Let's go.

907
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:24,718
Action!

908
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:26,631
Hello! Yes, everything is fine.

909
01:06:27,188 --> 01:06:29,051
Oh! Piya!

910
01:06:29,131 --> 01:06:31,465
Cut! Cut! Cut!
What are you doing? Go back.

911
01:06:31,548 --> 01:06:34,190
Energy. Loud. Feeling. Emotion.

912
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:37,173
Take 2. Ready? Action!

913
01:06:37,621 --> 01:06:40,100
Yes! No, no,
the weather is absolutely..

914
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:43,663
Oh! Piya?

915
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:45,756
Cut! Cut!

916
01:06:45,962 --> 01:06:47,840
What are you doing? Go back.

917
01:06:48,953 --> 01:06:50,511
Loud. Call out louder. Piya.

918
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:52,340
Take 3. Action!

919
01:06:52,423 --> 01:06:53,840
Yes, everything I fine..yes..

920
01:06:53,923 --> 01:06:55,798
Piya!

921
01:07:39,465 --> 01:07:40,756
Hello?

922
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:45,131
Hi!

923
01:07:50,256 --> 01:07:52,506
Me..me..

924
01:08:03,173 --> 01:08:04,816
Oh, my God! Champu?!

925
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,048
Yes. Yes.

926
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:18,006
You've changed so much, Champu!
- Yes!

927
01:08:23,256 --> 01:08:24,881
When did you come to New York?

928
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,781
This morning..today morning.

929
01:08:39,756 --> 01:08:41,090
He's hopeless.

930
01:08:45,314 --> 01:08:47,010
Darn kids!

931
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:52,631
Nice meeting you.

932
01:08:52,715 --> 01:08:54,256
Hi Piya.
- Hi. - Okay. Nice meeting you.

933
01:08:54,336 --> 01:08:55,840
Hi. Hi.

934
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,506
Zubin. Zubin Honibhoy.

935
01:08:57,586 --> 01:09:00,340
Piya, okay. Okay, bye!

936
01:09:01,465 --> 01:09:03,356
Bye, Piya. Bye!

937
01:09:03,725 --> 01:09:06,130
Where are you, Piya? Bye!

938
01:09:07,173 --> 01:09:08,465
Bye, Piya.

939
01:09:11,344 --> 01:09:14,731
Did you see how Piya just went
with Zubin? - I saw everything.

940
01:09:15,242 --> 01:09:18,326
Don't worry, she won't go for him.

941
01:09:18,756 --> 01:09:20,088
But what happened to you?

942
01:09:20,473 --> 01:09:21,881
Why were you tongue-tied?

943
01:09:24,053 --> 01:09:25,756
I had told you earlier
I can't do this.

944
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,798
The moment I see Piya,
something happens to me.

945
01:09:27,881 --> 01:09:29,508
I think I've bet on a lame horse.

946
01:09:29,587 --> 01:09:31,464
I have a bright idea.

947
01:09:32,225 --> 01:09:34,714
Sorry, I was listening to you both.
I couldn't help myself.

948
01:09:35,163 --> 01:09:38,259
This is a micro walkie-talkie.

949
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:43,173
With this, I sit here
and control my entire staff.

950
01:09:44,465 --> 01:09:46,176
You're incredible.

951
01:09:46,256 --> 01:09:49,927
When you decide to stop
showing off, tell us.

952
01:09:50,006 --> 01:09:51,598
We want to talk of
something important.

953
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,090
All right. I was just trying to help
you. - No, don't pay attention to him.

954
01:09:54,173 --> 01:09:55,468
Tell us what you wanted to.
What is this?

955
01:09:55,548 --> 01:09:57,093
Very good! Good boy.

956
01:09:57,173 --> 01:10:00,782
Look, you put this one
behind your ear and..

957
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:03,173
..the other one you
put behind your ear.

958
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,922
And then whatever you
want him to do, tell him.

959
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,256
Keep telling him,
and he'll keep doing as you say.

960
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:13,049
Great!
At least you were of some use.

961
01:10:13,129 --> 01:10:15,507
Come on, your work will be done.
- Thank you very much.

962
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:20,087
But listen, remember its range
is only 100 metres.

963
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:22,962
All right.
Come on, punk, let's rock.

964
01:10:23,342 --> 01:10:25,507
Suhan, Suhan.
Just once more. Once more.

965
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:26,837
Come on, punk, let's rock.

966
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:28,379
So darn clear.

967
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:30,629
Again, again.
- Oh, shut up.

968
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:32,921
Come on, punk, let's rock!

969
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:43,587
Give me your credit card.

970
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:46,602
Why?
- Why?

971
01:10:47,629 --> 01:10:50,754
Why am I asking this question?
I was just thinking that.

972
01:10:50,837 --> 01:10:53,421
After all, you're going for my work.
- Right.

973
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:55,587
Yes, you're going for my work.

974
01:10:55,671 --> 01:10:57,629
Not this one..give me this one.

975
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,421
From now on, this credit card
will remain with me.

976
01:11:00,504 --> 01:11:03,046
And until I return,
stay here in the car.

977
01:11:16,629 --> 01:11:19,212
Whatever I am going to get Piya man,
It's okay.

978
01:11:21,587 --> 01:11:22,639
What are you?

979
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,337
You didn't recognise me?
- No.

980
01:11:25,421 --> 01:11:27,129
Suhan. Suhan.

981
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:30,504
That means nobody will be
able to recognise me.

982
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:33,751
And I'll be
within 100 metres of you.

983
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,671
This is a book on Picasso.
- But this is an old book.

984
01:11:35,754 --> 01:11:38,462
It's second-hand,
so it'll look like you've read it.

985
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:02,628
Excuse me, Can I help you?

986
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:04,754
Oh! Champu, it's you?

987
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:09,075
I'm so sorry I.. - No. From you,
even Champu sounds sexy.

988
01:12:12,243 --> 01:12:14,296
But how come you're here?

989
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:19,796
I was passing by, and I saw that
it was an interiors shop..

990
01:12:19,876 --> 01:12:21,462
You..you work here?

991
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:24,436
No. This is my store.
I'm into interior designing.

992
01:12:24,516 --> 01:12:26,372
This is your store?
- Yes.

993
01:12:26,452 --> 01:12:28,650
These are all your designs.
- Yes.

994
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:30,004
Wow!

995
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:32,302
You know of this flower? Halcyon?

996
01:12:32,382 --> 01:12:34,087
Wonderful! Fabulous!

997
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:36,313
You like flowers?
- What?

998
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:37,837
You like flowers?

999
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:40,296
I love flowers.
- I love flowers.

1000
01:12:40,376 --> 01:12:43,256
Flowers are in my blood.
- Flowers are in my blood.

1001
01:12:43,336 --> 01:12:45,488
Looking at me..

1002
01:12:45,568 --> 01:12:47,705
..you may feel that flowers
and me are opposites.

1003
01:12:47,785 --> 01:12:50,046
But never judge a book by its cover.

1004
01:12:50,213 --> 01:12:52,579
You know the flower halcyon.

1005
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:56,347
It's found in the tropical
forest of South America.

1006
01:12:56,427 --> 01:12:57,434
Very good.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1007
01:12:57,514 --> 01:12:59,004
I don't even remember
your real name.

1008
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:02,167
Agastya Rao. Right.
- Agastya.

1009
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:04,291
Oh, wow. - No, no, Rao.
- Agastya Rao. - Yes.

1010
01:13:04,371 --> 01:13:09,613
I'm impressed. Though you're a guy,
you have such a passion for flowers.

1011
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:12,622
Listen, I don't believe
in this guy-girl thing.

1012
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:14,577
I don't believe in this guy-girl..

1013
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:15,994
I'm a homosexual.

1014
01:13:16,077 --> 01:13:17,520
I'm a homosexual.

1015
01:13:18,883 --> 01:13:20,327
Oh, no! Don't say that.

1016
01:13:20,836 --> 01:13:23,114
Metrosexual. Metrosexual.

1017
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,827
Metrosexual.

1018
01:13:25,202 --> 01:13:27,619
Drop the book.
- Oh.

1019
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:32,494
Thank you.
- You like Picasso?

1020
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:35,752
I like Picasso? I love Picasso.

1021
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:37,305
Picasso is in my blood.

1022
01:13:37,707 --> 01:13:39,178
But how did you know?

1023
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:43,955
Sharp observation.

1024
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:48,790
You know,
I've read this book four times.

1025
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:53,755
You know what is the best
thing about Picasso? - What?

1026
01:13:54,776 --> 01:13:56,332
Yes?

1027
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:03,502
So, you were telling me
something about Picasso.

1028
01:14:03,582 --> 01:14:08,477
Yes, Picasso. Picasso..

1029
01:14:09,423 --> 01:14:11,631
Who are you?
- Zorro.

1030
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:13,915
Zorro? Show me how you disappear.

1031
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:19,954
You really want
to know about Picasso?

1032
01:14:20,034 --> 01:14:22,499
You're a fraud. Fraud!

1033
01:14:22,582 --> 01:14:23,957
Do this and show me.

1034
01:14:26,465 --> 01:14:27,550
Idiot!

1035
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,332
Zubin, how could you do that?

1036
01:14:32,415 --> 01:14:33,652
No, Piya, I didn't do anything.

1037
01:14:33,732 --> 01:14:36,084
It was Zorro,
outside your boutique.

1038
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:39,128
Anyway, you guys won't believe it.

1039
01:14:46,461 --> 01:14:49,286
Agastya, I'm so glad that
you've come for dinner with us.

1040
01:14:50,082 --> 01:14:52,874
I had made all the arrangements
for French food.

1041
01:14:52,957 --> 01:14:55,483
But suddenly, how come you both
were in the mood for Italian?

1042
01:14:55,999 --> 01:14:57,332
You like Italian?

1043
01:14:57,412 --> 01:15:00,462
I like Italian? I love Italian.

1044
01:15:00,832 --> 01:15:02,419
Italian is in my blood.

1045
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:06,304
Suhan hadn't really got an opportunity
to wear costumes in his career.

1046
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:10,877
So he used this opportunity
to wear different costumes.

1047
01:15:10,957 --> 01:15:14,096
Always came in a different costume.
He was quite funny.

1048
01:15:19,665 --> 01:15:21,566
I'll have one penny Arabia.
- Okay.

1049
01:15:21,646 --> 01:15:23,290
I'll have the same. Thanks.

1050
01:15:23,374 --> 01:15:26,002
And I'll have a diet coke.
- Okay.

1051
01:15:26,082 --> 01:15:27,332
Just diet coke?

1052
01:15:27,415 --> 01:15:29,928
Come on, Zubin. Order something.

1053
01:15:30,332 --> 01:15:33,329
I..I hate Italian food.
Specially spicy food.

1054
01:15:33,957 --> 01:15:35,082
You don't like spicy food?

1055
01:15:35,165 --> 01:15:36,619
You don't like spicy food?

1056
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,415
You like spicy food?

1057
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,261
I like spicy food.
- I like spicy food.

1058
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:41,977
I love spicy food.
- I love spicy food.

1059
01:15:42,057 --> 01:15:44,544
Spice is in my blood.
- Spice is in my blood.

1060
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:07,464
Agastya, are you all right?
- Wicked, wicked.

1061
01:16:07,544 --> 01:16:09,153
I love spicy food.

1062
01:16:09,989 --> 01:16:13,540
Eat more of that..
what was that Italiano.. - Arabia.

1063
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,037
It's really nice.

1064
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:22,746
Idiot!

1065
01:16:28,438 --> 01:16:31,720
Hey, where is this man?
Where is this man? - There!

1066
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,752
You? You were
at the boutique too, right?

1067
01:17:23,832 --> 01:17:26,784
Now I know. You're following us.
You are..

1068
01:17:39,499 --> 01:17:41,557
Champu, your work is done.

1069
01:17:54,673 --> 01:17:56,164
What are you looking for, Agastya?

1070
01:17:57,531 --> 01:18:00,299
What am I looking for?

1071
01:18:00,663 --> 01:18:03,224
Yes, I've found it.
Brooklyn Bridge.

1072
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,215
I wanted to see it
since I was a kid.

1073
01:18:06,585 --> 01:18:08,424
It's really beautiful, isn't it?

1074
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,465
Thanks for everything.

1075
01:18:12,549 --> 01:18:15,973
You should thank Zubin, not me.
He paid the bill.

1076
01:18:17,174 --> 01:18:18,924
No, I didn't mean that.

1077
01:18:19,215 --> 01:18:21,281
I really had a great time tonight.

1078
01:18:22,574 --> 01:18:23,715
Me too.

1079
01:18:25,715 --> 01:18:30,674
In fact, it's seven years
since I've laughed so much.

1080
01:18:33,174 --> 01:18:34,424
Seven years?

1081
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:38,092
May I ask you something?
If you don't mind.

1082
01:18:38,924 --> 01:18:41,549
You loved a girl in college,
didn't you?

1083
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:47,328
I heard that she broke your heart..

1084
01:18:47,408 --> 01:18:50,632
..so you left college and went away.

1085
01:18:55,129 --> 01:18:57,112
We didn't know where you had gone.

1086
01:18:57,895 --> 01:19:00,295
You just disappeared.

1087
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,712
You used to love that
girl very much, right?

1088
01:19:06,692 --> 01:19:09,580
Do you love her still?

1089
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:17,047
I'm sorry. But I think
you've been unable to forget her.

1090
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:24,068
If you don't mind me asking,
who was she?

1091
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:29,329
Look, Agastya, you can trust me.
I might be of some help to you.

1092
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,446
Please, tell me who she was.

1093
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:34,696
You.

1094
01:19:42,438 --> 01:19:44,766
How can you help me?

1095
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:54,055
She's already married now.

1096
01:19:56,559 --> 01:20:00,720
Then you can get any nice girl.
Forget her.

1097
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,164
No. I'll only marry her.

1098
01:20:05,244 --> 01:20:06,629
No.

1099
01:20:07,795 --> 01:20:12,149
If I get married, it'll be to her.
Otherwise..

1100
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:16,047
If Suhan hadn't
come on time that day..

1101
01:20:16,372 --> 01:20:18,592
..the show would've ended
before the start.

1102
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:34,964
Bye, Zubin. Bye, Agastya.
Good night.

1103
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,853
In thirty seconds,
she'll come out wearing a nightgown.

1104
01:20:58,582 --> 01:21:00,851
But where did I keep
the remote this morning?

1105
01:21:06,718 --> 01:21:08,208
Yes, in the kitchen.

1106
01:21:12,561 --> 01:21:14,375
She'll jump on the couch.

1107
01:21:16,676 --> 01:21:18,301
Now she'll watch
an emotional movie..

1108
01:21:18,385 --> 01:21:19,995
..and cry like Meena Kumari
(Indian actress).

1109
01:21:27,411 --> 01:21:28,551
What are you doing?

1110
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:31,010
I'm eating chocolate
and studying the case.

1111
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:33,340
Okay. Now, excuse me. Let me see.

1112
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,980
Hey, buddy, I have to write
the dialogues of this script.

1113
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,551
What will you do by watching?

1114
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,843
I don't think you should
watch like this. - Why?

1115
01:21:41,284 --> 01:21:42,885
Then you too will fall in love.

1116
01:21:43,905 --> 01:21:45,218
What?

1117
01:21:48,576 --> 01:21:51,676
I don't need anybody's love.
I'm happy alone.

1118
01:21:51,888 --> 01:21:53,577
Keep your Piya to yourself.

1119
01:21:56,049 --> 01:21:57,385
Now what have you done?

1120
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:14,218
Satellite connection?

1121
01:22:14,298 --> 01:22:17,139
No. Telescope.
- Oh! Fantastic.

1122
01:22:17,743 --> 01:22:19,676
The clarity is excellent.

1123
01:22:20,218 --> 01:22:21,741
Popcorn?
- Yes.

1124
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:36,385
"It's an unknown city."

1125
01:23:38,277 --> 01:23:45,551
"It's an unknown evening."

1126
01:23:47,585 --> 01:23:50,385
"Life is.."

1127
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:57,635
"..unknown."

1128
01:24:01,967 --> 01:24:09,301
"What is your name?"

1129
01:24:11,635 --> 01:24:16,290
"Strange is this life.
This life is strange."

1130
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:18,648
"Here you meet, then separate."

1131
01:24:18,728 --> 01:24:21,586
"After separation, again we meet."

1132
01:24:27,797 --> 01:24:36,218
"It's an unknown city."

1133
01:25:24,798 --> 01:25:33,468
"Without you,
I feel sadness is sweet."

1134
01:25:34,203 --> 01:25:43,051
"What? Is this your magic?"

1135
01:25:43,635 --> 01:25:52,260
"You aren't aware that
the earth under your feet is saying."

1136
01:25:52,968 --> 01:26:01,635
"What? Is this your thought?"

1137
01:26:01,819 --> 01:26:11,437
"It's an unknown city."

1138
01:26:15,936 --> 01:26:23,510
"I found life."

1139
01:26:25,736 --> 01:26:30,360
"Strange is this life.
This life is strange."

1140
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,737
"I had thought it's near."

1141
01:26:32,817 --> 01:26:35,713
"But it's somebody else's destiny."

1142
01:27:16,382 --> 01:27:19,968
"It's the incident of one night."

1143
01:27:21,132 --> 01:27:25,176
"You were lying on the clouds."

1144
01:27:27,233 --> 01:27:34,471
"I remember you had called me."

1145
01:27:35,043 --> 01:27:38,835
"You were feeling cold."

1146
01:27:39,908 --> 01:27:43,999
"You had draped thin
moonlight on yourself."

1147
01:27:44,642 --> 01:27:53,176
"And you were sleeping
in a shawl of dreams."

1148
01:27:53,492 --> 01:28:03,426
"Let it be strange.."

1149
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:15,557
"..but you are merged
in my breaths."

1150
01:28:17,352 --> 01:28:22,180
"Strange is this life.
This life is strange."

1151
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:27,047
"This life is not for me.
It's the destiny of somebody else."

1152
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:11,854
The first time I saw a faint hope
of love in Piya's eyes for me.

1153
01:29:21,176 --> 01:29:22,884
You look stunning.
- Thanks.

1154
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:35,346
How do I look?
- Like a Rock star.

1155
01:29:35,426 --> 01:29:38,342
No, a superstar.

1156
01:29:38,422 --> 01:29:40,040
No, a superstar.

1157
01:29:42,884 --> 01:29:46,762
What happened? - No. Nothing.
I just remembered something.

1158
01:29:46,842 --> 01:29:48,935
Good or bad?
- Good or bad?

1159
01:29:50,513 --> 01:29:51,426
Good.

1160
01:30:23,829 --> 01:30:26,387
Hi, could I have
a glass of red wine please?

1161
01:30:26,467 --> 01:30:28,259
Get buzz!
- What will you have?

1162
01:30:28,926 --> 01:30:31,342
Apple juice.
- And wine.

1163
01:30:31,967 --> 01:30:33,021
And wine.

1164
01:30:38,064 --> 01:30:40,034
Now drink the two as a cocktail.

1165
01:30:40,114 --> 01:30:42,153
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1166
01:30:49,491 --> 01:30:50,917
Cheers.

1167
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:12,848
Why are you looking at me like this?

1168
01:31:12,928 --> 01:31:14,759
I'm looking at your sixth smile.

1169
01:31:15,302 --> 01:31:17,311
I'm looking at your sixth smile.

1170
01:31:17,759 --> 01:31:19,762
What! - Do you know you
have 6 kinds of smiles?

1171
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:21,717
Do you know you have
6 kinds of smiles?

1172
01:31:21,797 --> 01:31:24,762
Smile number one,
when you smile whole-heartedly.

1173
01:31:24,842 --> 01:31:27,901
Smile number one,
when you smile whole-heartedly.

1174
01:31:27,981 --> 01:31:31,137
Smile number two,
when you smile in pretence.

1175
01:31:31,217 --> 01:31:35,387
Smile number three,
when you smile shyly.

1176
01:31:35,467 --> 01:31:39,926
Smile number four,
when you smile mischievously.

1177
01:31:40,006 --> 01:31:44,501
Smile number five
when you smile to greet somebody.

1178
01:31:44,581 --> 01:31:46,134
And smile no. 6..

1179
01:31:46,217 --> 01:31:48,302
When you smile to hide something.

1180
01:31:48,382 --> 01:31:51,884
When you smile to hide something.

1181
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,176
This is your sixth smile.

1182
01:31:56,259 --> 01:31:57,848
What are you hiding from me?

1183
01:32:05,502 --> 01:32:06,746
Agastya.

1184
01:32:07,106 --> 01:32:08,813
Agastya. Agastya.

1185
01:32:31,967 --> 01:32:32,967
Wow!

1186
01:32:55,426 --> 01:32:56,717
Excuse me.

1187
01:32:58,759 --> 01:33:00,560
Get out of here.
Excuse me.

1188
01:33:01,356 --> 01:33:03,256
Agastya, go to Piya.

1189
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,065
Agastya!

1190
01:33:10,176 --> 01:33:11,634
Agastya!

1191
01:33:35,551 --> 01:33:36,842
Sorry.

1192
01:33:41,926 --> 01:33:43,267
Champu, call them outside.

1193
01:33:43,347 --> 01:33:46,967
Suhan, these are six well built
people. And we are only two.

1194
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:50,051
Actually, there's only one person.
- Just do what I've told you to do.

1195
01:33:50,384 --> 01:33:51,676
Okay.

1196
01:33:54,842 --> 01:34:00,176
You...You...You.
Can you please come out?

1197
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:03,217
You want to act tough.

1198
01:34:03,551 --> 01:34:04,947
Meet us outside.

1199
01:34:13,759 --> 01:34:16,329
You're a dead man.
- Hey!

1200
01:34:16,409 --> 01:34:18,217
Agastya, please.

1201
01:34:18,297 --> 01:34:21,265
These are very nasty people.
Don't lock horns with them.

1202
01:34:27,259 --> 01:34:28,467
I'll come back.

1203
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:29,967
Agastya..

1204
01:35:18,651 --> 01:35:20,922
Champu, let go of me. Let go.

1205
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:25,207
Oh, man.

1206
01:35:44,926 --> 01:35:45,996
Suhan, stop it.

1207
01:35:46,076 --> 01:35:48,133
Suhan was furious.

1208
01:35:48,551 --> 01:35:50,570
I tried in vain to stop him.

1209
01:35:50,967 --> 01:35:54,804
If there was anyone
who could stop him, it was Piya.

1210
01:35:54,884 --> 01:35:56,297
Agastya!

1211
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:05,086
Agastya.
- Who are you?

1212
01:36:08,884 --> 01:36:10,876
Oh, my God, Agastya!
Are you all right?

1213
01:36:12,134 --> 01:36:16,301
Listen, don't you ever,
ever say..one second.

1214
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:18,342
Don't you ever say anything to her!
Okay!

1215
01:36:18,422 --> 01:36:20,304
I'll send everyone to the moon.

1216
01:36:20,384 --> 01:36:22,648
What a knock-out punch
Suhan landed on my face.

1217
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:24,724
I was seeing stars in daylight.

1218
01:36:24,944 --> 01:36:27,634
Piya had great respect for me.

1219
01:36:27,714 --> 01:36:29,845
From an idiot Champu,
I had become a Champion to her.

1220
01:36:41,759 --> 01:36:42,919
Piya.

1221
01:36:43,634 --> 01:36:46,346
Hi.
- There's a small party at my home.

1222
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:49,139
So I've called to invite you.
- Party!

1223
01:36:51,342 --> 01:36:54,067
Yes. A birthday party.
- Birthday party!

1224
01:36:54,884 --> 01:36:58,101
Yes, yes. Of course I'll come.
I'll come.

1225
01:37:00,177 --> 01:37:01,642
This evening?

1226
01:37:02,259 --> 01:37:05,009
I have a meeting this evening.

1227
01:37:05,092 --> 01:37:08,509
Oh, no! It would be great
if you could come.

1228
01:37:08,967 --> 01:37:11,592
Anyway no stress. Work comes first.

1229
01:37:11,676 --> 01:37:15,174
Yes, of course, work comes first.

1230
01:37:16,426 --> 01:37:18,342
Okay. Bye-bye. Take care.

1231
01:37:18,426 --> 01:37:19,842
Why did Suhan do that?

1232
01:37:19,926 --> 01:37:22,387
Why did he stop me
from going to Piya's party?

1233
01:37:22,467 --> 01:37:24,762
I had many such queries in my mind.

1234
01:37:24,842 --> 01:37:27,014
But I didn't have
the courage to ask him.

1235
01:37:27,094 --> 01:37:28,759
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1236
01:37:28,842 --> 01:37:31,342
I'm John Winter. Writer.
- Pleasure to meet you.

1237
01:37:31,634 --> 01:37:33,887
I've been noticing you
for the last couple of days.

1238
01:37:33,967 --> 01:37:37,592
All those get-ups.
- All right.

1239
01:37:38,467 --> 01:37:41,301
Are you an actor by any chance?
- Yes.

1240
01:37:41,485 --> 01:37:44,384
Do you want an autograph?
- Actually, no.

1241
01:37:44,467 --> 01:37:45,842
Then don't waste my time.

1242
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:49,217
Just a second.
I have something to tell you.

1243
01:37:49,467 --> 01:37:54,429
I'm writing a major television
sitcom called 'Vikram and Juliet'.

1244
01:37:54,509 --> 01:37:56,794
It's a romantic comedy about..

1245
01:37:56,874 --> 01:38:00,301
..an Indian Vikram falling
in love with American Juliet.

1246
01:38:00,384 --> 01:38:03,007
And you want me to play Vikram?
- Well. Not exactly.

1247
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:06,221
I'm offering the role of
Vikram's driver. Chakram.

1248
01:38:06,301 --> 01:38:09,406
What? You don't know
who you're talking to right now.

1249
01:38:09,702 --> 01:38:11,301
You misunderstand.

1250
01:38:11,384 --> 01:38:13,384
Chakram is a major character.

1251
01:38:13,467 --> 01:38:18,634
I only do main leads.
I'm a superstar.

1252
01:38:19,176 --> 01:38:20,259
Ciao.

1253
01:38:37,124 --> 01:38:39,301
Let me go.
Please.

1254
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:42,217
What are you doing?

1255
01:38:43,386 --> 01:38:48,382
Please, for God's sake.
Please, please, let me go.

1256
01:38:50,001 --> 01:38:51,340
Everybody's leaving.

1257
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:56,509
What?

1258
01:38:57,717 --> 01:38:59,767
Now what do I do?
The party has got over.

1259
01:38:59,847 --> 01:39:02,592
Everything is over. They have gone.
Should I go to wash the vessels?

1260
01:39:22,095 --> 01:39:23,592
Hi.
- Hi.

1261
01:39:23,676 --> 01:39:25,134
Agastya, you?

1262
01:39:25,214 --> 01:39:28,148
Wow! You had some urgent work,
didn't you?

1263
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:31,093
Yes. I realised that
no work is more..

1264
01:39:31,384 --> 01:39:33,387
..important than friendship.

1265
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:35,259
So I left everything
and I came here.

1266
01:39:36,217 --> 01:39:39,759
Well, I'm so sorry, but the party..
- Is over.

1267
01:39:40,133 --> 01:39:41,884
Everybody had their
fill and they've left.

1268
01:39:42,634 --> 01:39:44,551
It means your friend has
come at the right time.

1269
01:39:44,884 --> 01:39:48,176
Would you require my assistance?
- Sure! Come on in!

1270
01:39:57,092 --> 01:40:00,009
Great, my brave one!
You have reached inside her house.

1271
01:40:00,259 --> 01:40:01,692
And in a short while,
enter her heart as well.

1272
01:40:01,772 --> 01:40:04,051
Second table, chips and coke.

1273
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:05,967
What are you saying?
Champu?

1274
01:40:06,217 --> 01:40:08,721
Yes. It's my pleasure, ma'am.

1275
01:40:08,801 --> 01:40:09,628
A cross-connection.

1276
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:10,570
Darn!

1277
01:40:35,537 --> 01:40:37,051
Piya!

1278
01:40:37,226 --> 01:40:39,176
Brilliant! Brilliant!

1279
01:40:39,259 --> 01:40:41,259
Oh, god. How beautiful they are!

1280
01:40:42,055 --> 01:40:45,152
I mean..may I touch them?

1281
01:40:45,592 --> 01:40:47,106
Come here.

1282
01:40:47,759 --> 01:40:49,244
Open the window.

1283
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:53,426
May I kiss..
- Champu! Open the window.

1284
01:40:55,342 --> 01:40:59,554
Such a cute baby!
Looks just like you.

1285
01:40:59,634 --> 01:41:02,759
Come on, stop crying.

1286
01:41:35,217 --> 01:41:37,926
Such a sweet baby!
Looks just like you.

1287
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:40,509
He sits so quietly.

1288
01:41:40,592 --> 01:41:44,429
She sits very quietly.
Her name is Suhani.

1289
01:41:44,509 --> 01:41:47,592
She's my little angel.
And today is her birthday.

1290
01:41:57,819 --> 01:42:01,759
Suhan. Suhan, please.
Suhan, please get up.

1291
01:42:02,051 --> 01:42:04,551
What is it?
- Thank God! There's just 5 minutes.

1292
01:42:04,634 --> 01:42:06,701
I'm not feeling well.
I can't come.

1293
01:42:06,781 --> 01:42:08,267
Suhan, please get up.

1294
01:42:08,347 --> 01:42:10,509
If she talks,
how will I answer her.

1295
01:42:10,592 --> 01:42:12,762
Suhan!
- Take her out to watch some movie.

1296
01:42:12,842 --> 01:42:14,051
You needn't talk to her then.

1297
01:42:14,131 --> 01:42:17,009
Tell me which movie
I should take her to? Please.

1298
01:43:08,627 --> 01:43:11,390
Hi.
- Hello, young man.

1299
01:43:11,891 --> 01:43:13,051
Pizza.
- Yeah Pizza.

1300
01:43:13,134 --> 01:43:14,842
Great! Great!

1301
01:43:39,759 --> 01:43:40,926
Oh, my God!

1302
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:30,480
Hi. My name is Suhan Kapoor.
I'm your father.

1303
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:34,092
I'm your papa.

1304
01:44:35,971 --> 01:44:37,259
Hi.

1305
01:44:38,523 --> 01:44:40,009
No handshake?

1306
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:42,621
Fingershake.

1307
01:44:42,884 --> 01:44:44,259
Fingershake.

1308
01:44:44,873 --> 01:44:46,384
Fingershake.

1309
01:44:56,423 --> 01:44:59,291
My little angel. You're an angel.

1310
01:45:00,056 --> 01:45:02,092
May I carry you in my arms?

1311
01:45:04,544 --> 01:45:05,634
You sure?

1312
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:06,717
Thank you.

1313
01:45:07,886 --> 01:45:11,035
Oh, yes. Wow!

1314
01:45:13,181 --> 01:45:15,533
Come, let's sit.

1315
01:45:18,443 --> 01:45:21,513
Oh, my God.

1316
01:45:22,006 --> 01:45:26,884
Same eyes. Same nose. Same lips.

1317
01:45:30,509 --> 01:45:33,213
You're my replica.

1318
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:38,342
Your smile is just like your papa.

1319
01:45:41,562 --> 01:45:44,520
Suhan forgot about time
with his daughter.

1320
01:45:44,603 --> 01:45:46,562
When Piya and I returned..

1321
01:45:48,687 --> 01:45:51,103
Maria, what are you doing outside?
Where's Suhani?

1322
01:45:51,395 --> 01:45:54,770
She's inside. I got locked out.
- Oh, my God.

1323
01:45:56,437 --> 01:45:58,525
How can you be so careless?
I don't believe this.

1324
01:46:09,081 --> 01:46:12,064
Oh, my sweetheart! I'm so sorry!

1325
01:46:12,144 --> 01:46:14,478
Come here, baby. Come here.

1326
01:46:17,721 --> 01:46:19,437
It's very cold.

1327
01:46:19,937 --> 01:46:22,243
Thank you.

1328
01:46:22,516 --> 01:46:25,692
May I ask you something?
- Yes.

1329
01:46:27,477 --> 01:46:29,270
Actually..

1330
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:31,392
No, no.

1331
01:46:34,312 --> 01:46:35,686
What's the matter, Agastya?

1332
01:46:36,556 --> 01:46:41,895
I.. that.. But..

1333
01:46:41,978 --> 01:46:44,968
Agastya! - Did you marry the guy
whom you used to love in college?

1334
01:46:45,048 --> 01:46:47,906
I just wanted to ask that. If you
don't want to answer, then it's okay.

1335
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:50,906
I understand. I'm sorry.
Just forget it.

1336
01:46:50,986 --> 01:46:54,055
Oh, my God! What am I doing?
- Yes.

1337
01:46:57,103 --> 01:46:58,228
Then..

1338
01:47:00,645 --> 01:47:02,062
Then..

1339
01:47:04,525 --> 01:47:07,181
All our wishes
in life will not be fulfilled.

1340
01:47:15,057 --> 01:47:17,549
Congratulations, Piya. You're pregnant.

1341
01:47:20,688 --> 01:47:22,130
Thank you, doctor.

1342
01:47:39,902 --> 01:47:41,437
Are we going somewhere?

1343
01:47:48,062 --> 01:47:52,650
"I'm worried because
of this helplessness."

1344
01:47:52,730 --> 01:47:57,145
"You'll be sad to know.
But I'm with you."

1345
01:47:57,225 --> 01:48:01,781
"I'll have to stay away from you."

1346
01:48:01,861 --> 01:48:06,228
"Just endure it for a while."

1347
01:48:06,308 --> 01:48:10,857
"My future, I swear on you."

1348
01:48:10,937 --> 01:48:15,523
"My future hinges on this, Piya."

1349
01:48:15,603 --> 01:48:20,273
"I know that love is naive."

1350
01:48:20,353 --> 01:48:26,421
"The heart tends
to make some mistakes."

1351
01:48:26,937 --> 01:48:30,827
"Love is oblivious of patience."

1352
01:48:31,383 --> 01:48:32,897
You didn't tell him?

1353
01:48:33,789 --> 01:48:37,261
How could I have told him?
That day, he was very happy.

1354
01:48:37,851 --> 01:48:40,618
The greatest dream of his life
was going to be fulfilled.

1355
01:48:41,899 --> 01:48:43,694
But when I realized that..

1356
01:48:44,562 --> 01:48:49,571
..our marriage was creating barrier
for his dreams, then I decided.

1357
01:48:50,923 --> 01:48:53,231
By giving him this news,
I couldn't break his dreams.

1358
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:56,525
What did you do?

1359
01:48:58,046 --> 01:48:59,587
I waited for him.

1360
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:05,773
I tried many times to talk
with Suhan in my loneliness.

1361
01:49:05,853 --> 01:49:09,298
Ma'am, can I speak
with Suhan please? - Who is this?

1362
01:49:10,030 --> 01:49:14,155
I..I..

1363
01:49:14,728 --> 01:49:16,395
What could I say?

1364
01:49:16,478 --> 01:49:19,841
He had warned me not to tell
anyone about our relationship.

1365
01:49:20,937 --> 01:49:23,833
I had no choice but to wait.

1366
01:49:25,978 --> 01:49:28,380
The wait of a few weeks
converted into months.

1367
01:49:29,145 --> 01:49:31,187
But I received no news of Suhan.

1368
01:49:32,533 --> 01:49:34,645
I was all alone in that city.

1369
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:37,353
And then one day..

1370
01:49:40,478 --> 01:49:42,693
My brother Vishal came to visit me.

1371
01:49:45,187 --> 01:49:47,312
He couldn't bear
to see my condition.

1372
01:49:50,665 --> 01:49:54,297
I had eloped to marry
against my family's wishes.

1373
01:49:56,521 --> 01:49:59,997
But still, they forgave me.

1374
01:50:03,353 --> 01:50:08,728
Vishal told me not to stay
alone there in such a condition.

1375
01:50:20,203 --> 01:50:21,624
So did he come?

1376
01:50:24,052 --> 01:50:25,502
He didn't come.

1377
01:50:27,728 --> 01:50:29,353
But I got a divorce notice.

1378
01:50:41,603 --> 01:50:42,864
Forget about him.

1379
01:50:43,798 --> 01:50:45,933
You can easily
find another good man.

1380
01:50:48,653 --> 01:50:52,001
You had said some dialogue like
that to me near Brooklyn Bridge.

1381
01:50:52,603 --> 01:50:53,718
Remember?

1382
01:50:55,273 --> 01:50:58,004
Agastya, you're so sweet.
Thank you.

1383
01:51:13,687 --> 01:51:15,600
Bye.
- But listen, don't forget.

1384
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:18,506
Tomorrow, we have to go to my
parents' anniversary celebration.

1385
01:52:31,437 --> 01:52:32,916
Goodnight, Piya.

1386
01:52:53,404 --> 01:52:55,062
Now papa has to leave.

1387
01:52:57,521 --> 01:52:59,478
Don't worry. Papa will come again.

1388
01:52:59,558 --> 01:53:02,020
But there's been a change
in the plan.

1389
01:53:02,624 --> 01:53:04,538
Now, I'll take your mummy along too.

1390
01:53:05,129 --> 01:53:07,270
She isn't that bad, you know.

1391
01:53:08,931 --> 01:53:10,240
Fingershake.

1392
01:53:16,687 --> 01:53:17,937
Bye, sweetheart.

1393
01:53:48,179 --> 01:53:49,228
Boney!

1394
01:53:49,308 --> 01:53:51,642
Uncle.
- Suhan!

1395
01:53:51,895 --> 01:53:54,103
What progress has
there been in the mission?

1396
01:53:56,556 --> 01:53:57,710
Suhan, what's the matter?

1397
01:53:58,730 --> 01:53:59,978
Is everything fine?

1398
01:54:00,215 --> 01:54:03,591
Uncle, we were wrong about Piya.

1399
01:54:42,083 --> 01:54:47,645
Look..we have committed
a grave mistake, Suhan.

1400
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,520
Now what do you want to do?

1401
01:54:51,603 --> 01:54:53,695
What I should have done
a long time ago, uncle.

1402
01:54:55,687 --> 01:54:57,333
I want to take up
my responsibilities.

1403
01:54:58,185 --> 01:55:00,687
Uncle, I want to
take care of my child.

1404
01:55:01,402 --> 01:55:03,168
Uncle, what I did was wrong.

1405
01:55:03,752 --> 01:55:05,770
I want to rectify my mistake.

1406
01:55:08,785 --> 01:55:12,145
Uncle, I want Piya and the baby..

1407
01:55:14,473 --> 01:55:16,020
..both back.

1408
01:55:17,091 --> 01:55:21,187
But how will you do all this?

1409
01:55:49,294 --> 01:55:50,454
Hey, John.

1410
01:55:55,645 --> 01:55:57,493
You know the job
that you offered me.

1411
01:55:58,971 --> 01:56:00,194
I'll do it.

1412
01:56:00,405 --> 01:56:02,858
That part has already been cast.

1413
01:56:07,803 --> 01:56:11,088
I really need it. - You're a superstar.
Why do you need anything?

1414
01:56:11,168 --> 01:56:14,440
If I need you, I'll find you.
Now just get out of my face.

1415
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:15,817
I'm working.

1416
01:56:24,761 --> 01:56:26,196
I'm sorry. I'll get it.

1417
01:56:28,281 --> 01:56:31,895
Hey, John. I'm really sorry.
I was so rude.

1418
01:56:32,644 --> 01:56:34,510
I know you must be really upset with me.

1419
01:56:35,395 --> 01:56:37,773
I wasn't nice. I was rude.

1420
01:56:38,398 --> 01:56:41,767
In fact, I was a jerk.

1421
01:56:44,248 --> 01:56:45,611
But look at me now.

1422
01:56:46,187 --> 01:56:47,937
I'm on my knees.

1423
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:51,320
I'm begging you.
Embarrassed.

1424
01:56:53,818 --> 01:56:55,059
I'm really sorry.

1425
01:56:56,103 --> 01:56:57,608
I'm a changed man, John.

1426
01:57:00,486 --> 01:57:05,062
Listen, I need to prove
to my wife and my child..

1427
01:57:05,541 --> 01:57:06,888
Come on. Please.

1428
01:57:07,231 --> 01:57:09,853
Help me with this.
Just one audition.

1429
01:57:09,933 --> 01:57:13,648
I'm sorry. The part of Chakram..

1430
01:57:13,728 --> 01:57:15,324
..it's gone to someone else.

1431
01:57:17,687 --> 01:57:21,738
But I'll try and get you
an audition for another part.

1432
01:57:23,673 --> 01:57:26,551
Come to the studio tomorrow. 9am.

1433
01:57:31,846 --> 01:57:34,591
Suhan woke up earlier
than me that day.

1434
01:57:35,721 --> 01:57:39,034
Piya, today I'm going to
start my new life.

1435
01:57:39,544 --> 01:57:41,184
Please, wish me all the best.

1436
01:58:15,478 --> 01:58:17,130
Mr. John Winters' audition.

1437
01:58:18,187 --> 01:58:19,437
Second door around the corner.

1438
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:20,770
Thank you.

1439
01:58:40,812 --> 01:58:41,967
Beautiful!

1440
01:58:42,047 --> 01:58:45,802
Are you a princess?
- No.

1441
01:58:46,259 --> 01:58:48,187
But my father is very wealthy.

1442
01:58:48,267 --> 01:58:50,145
Why don't you live here then?

1443
01:58:50,228 --> 01:58:52,937
There'll be a room
for you in such a big mansion.

1444
01:58:53,086 --> 01:58:54,937
Yes. They all want that too.

1445
01:58:55,017 --> 01:58:59,728
But whenever I come here,
papa harps on the same thing.

1446
01:58:59,808 --> 01:59:01,812
My marriage.
- Yes.

1447
01:59:13,898 --> 01:59:16,687
You must have informed them
that I'm coming.

1448
01:59:16,767 --> 01:59:18,853
Otherwise, they may think a babysitter
is coming along with you.

1449
01:59:19,366 --> 01:59:22,761
Of course, Agastya.
In fact, papa is waiting for you.

1450
01:59:28,833 --> 01:59:30,239
Hello, sir.

1451
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:32,312
What are you doing, Agastya?

1452
01:59:32,392 --> 01:59:34,556
He's not papa. He's our butler.

1453
01:59:39,137 --> 01:59:40,947
Hello. Agastya here.

1454
02:00:03,839 --> 02:00:06,259
Hi, everyone. I'm home.

1455
02:00:06,339 --> 02:00:07,763
Hi, Piya!

1456
02:00:09,795 --> 02:00:11,423
Introduce me. - Oh.

1457
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,339
He's my friend, Agastya.

1458
02:00:13,422 --> 02:00:15,457
Hello, darling.
- Hi!

1459
02:00:15,537 --> 02:00:16,589
Nice meeting you.

1460
02:00:16,672 --> 02:00:18,255
Piya's Aunty. - Oh, is that so?

1461
02:00:18,339 --> 02:00:19,505
Piya's uncle. - Okay, okay.

1462
02:00:19,589 --> 02:00:21,967
Piya's uncle.
- Hello, sir.

1463
02:00:22,047 --> 02:00:26,921
He's not bad. - He's so sexy.
- Does he have a younger brother?

1464
02:00:27,839 --> 02:00:29,792
'Does he have an elder brother?

1465
02:00:30,339 --> 02:00:32,964
Every mother wants the best
for her child, and so do I.

1466
02:00:33,047 --> 02:00:36,089
Every mother wants the best
for her baby. - So do I.

1467
02:00:36,172 --> 02:00:38,589
That's why I've chosen.
- Booboo diapers.

1468
02:00:38,672 --> 02:00:40,922
Booboo diapers have
a rapid dry system..

1469
02:00:41,005 --> 02:00:43,214
..with triple protection
from leak b..barriers.

1470
02:00:43,297 --> 02:00:45,969
Triple protection
from leaking barriers.

1471
02:00:46,049 --> 02:00:48,255
That protects against leakage.
- Day and night.

1472
02:00:48,339 --> 02:00:49,964
So if you love your baby.

1473
02:00:50,047 --> 02:00:53,797
Clearly, Booboo diapers.
- Booboo diapers is the choice.

1474
02:00:54,172 --> 02:00:56,464
You're so good looking.
I'm sure you're an actor.

1475
02:00:56,547 --> 02:00:59,255
No, I'm not an actor,
I'm an astronaut from NASA

1476
02:00:59,339 --> 02:01:01,825
Astronaut?
- Yes! - Travelled to the moon?

1477
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:04,755
Who else is there in your family?
- Actually, I'm alone.

1478
02:01:04,835 --> 02:01:07,217
From my childhood I was alone,
my parents..

1479
02:01:07,297 --> 02:01:09,630
Self-made man.
- Yes.

1480
02:01:11,672 --> 02:01:13,839
I'm Samrat Goyal. Piya's father.

1481
02:01:13,922 --> 02:01:16,047
Pleasure meeting you, sir.
Pleasure meeting you.

1482
02:01:16,130 --> 02:01:18,464
Happy anniversary.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1483
02:01:18,547 --> 02:01:20,672
I like self-made man.
- Thank you.

1484
02:01:20,755 --> 02:01:23,759
You know when
I had come to New York..

1485
02:01:23,839 --> 02:01:27,634
Excuse me. - I had just $5 in my pocket.
- Yes.

1486
02:01:27,922 --> 02:01:30,755
With those $5..

1487
02:01:30,839 --> 02:01:34,759
He's the guy who is after Piya.
Today he has reached the house.

1488
02:01:34,839 --> 02:01:36,297
Since when are you seeing him?

1489
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:38,797
What does the guy do?
- Who else is there in his family?

1490
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:40,714
Does he smoke cigarettes?
- When are you guys marrying?

1491
02:01:40,797 --> 02:01:43,464
Next Monday is good to marry.
- Please!

1492
02:01:43,544 --> 02:01:46,339
Specially with the software in..

1493
02:01:46,422 --> 02:01:48,672
Let me introduce my..
- Uncle, let me guess.

1494
02:01:48,752 --> 02:01:52,675
He's Vishal,
Piya's brother and your son?

1495
02:01:52,755 --> 02:01:54,047
Correct.

1496
02:01:54,130 --> 02:01:56,092
How did you know?
- Piya told me.

1497
02:01:56,172 --> 02:02:00,217
And she said that you're tall,
handsome.. intelligent, good looking.

1498
02:02:00,297 --> 02:02:02,592
I like this guy, dad.
- Thank you. - Very good!

1499
02:02:02,672 --> 02:02:06,089
You guys enjoy. I'll see you later.
- All right, uncle. See you.

1500
02:02:06,172 --> 02:02:06,906
You're not having anything.

1501
02:02:06,986 --> 02:02:09,300
Should I get you a drink?
- Maybe..

1502
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:10,547
Maybe champagne.

1503
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:11,297
Gentlemen's drink.

1504
02:02:11,377 --> 02:02:13,547
Absolutely. Thanks.

1505
02:02:13,714 --> 02:02:15,464
Hi, my name is Agastya.

1506
02:02:16,339 --> 02:02:17,815
Hello. - Vishal.

1507
02:02:21,089 --> 02:02:23,634
Hi. - Hi. - Hi.

1508
02:02:23,714 --> 02:02:26,297
Hi. I'm Dabbu, Piya's cousin.

1509
02:02:26,922 --> 02:02:29,624
Even I want to be
an astronaut like you.

1510
02:02:32,089 --> 02:02:33,505
Wow! Brownies!

1511
02:02:33,589 --> 02:02:37,911
So this Agastya..you didn't
tell us anything about him before.

1512
02:02:38,386 --> 02:02:40,634
Mom, now you too are
behaving like everybody..

1513
02:02:40,714 --> 02:02:42,380
What do you expect, darling?

1514
02:02:42,464 --> 02:02:46,050
For the first time,
you've brought a guy home.

1515
02:02:46,422 --> 02:02:49,259
He's just a friend.
I don't love him.

1516
02:02:51,339 --> 02:02:55,464
Piya, if you want to live happily..

1517
02:02:56,164 --> 02:02:59,172
..then choose the person who
loves you as your life partner.

1518
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:05,547
The one you loved never
gave you any happiness.

1519
02:03:08,589 --> 02:03:11,005
Why do you think
that Agastya loves me?

1520
02:03:12,464 --> 02:03:13,839
Are you serious?

1521
02:03:14,387 --> 02:03:17,380
Can't you see what we all can see?

1522
02:03:31,738 --> 02:03:35,089
So if you really love
your child, clearly..

1523
02:03:35,172 --> 02:03:38,589
Booboo diaper is the choice.

1524
02:03:50,839 --> 02:03:53,047
Good morning,
my name is Suhan Kapoor.

1525
02:03:56,547 --> 02:03:59,380
Every mother wants the best
for her baby. So do I.

1526
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:03,630
That's the reason
why I've chosen Booboo diapers.

1527
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:08,214
Booboo diapers has a rapid dry
system with triple protection..

1528
02:04:14,005 --> 02:04:15,255
But what's new with that?

1529
02:04:15,464 --> 02:04:17,089
Every other diaper in town has that.

1530
02:04:20,255 --> 02:04:23,255
The reason why
I bought Booboo diapers is..

1531
02:04:24,089 --> 02:04:25,672
..because they're really
easy to change.

1532
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:30,005
Even an idiot like me who doesn't
know anything can change them.

1533
02:04:30,339 --> 02:04:32,672
Now my wife doesn't have to wake
up in the middle of the night..

1534
02:04:32,755 --> 02:04:35,589
..to change our baby's diapers.
I do.

1535
02:04:35,964 --> 02:04:37,880
And it only takes about five seconds.

1536
02:04:38,214 --> 02:04:40,630
So if you love your child,
if you love your wife..

1537
02:04:40,714 --> 02:04:43,755
..then Booboo diapers
is the right choice.

1538
02:04:45,089 --> 02:04:47,422
That was brilliant, Mr. Kapoor!

1539
02:04:47,922 --> 02:04:51,005
As much as we loved your work,
we cannot select you.

1540
02:04:51,505 --> 02:04:55,589
What we are looking for here is
a mother talking about her baby.

1541
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:57,089
A woman.

1542
02:04:57,339 --> 02:05:00,714
Sir, do you know Mr. John Winters.
He asked me to audition for this part.

1543
02:05:00,922 --> 02:05:04,380
I'm afraid, my dear friend, you
have come to the wrong audition.

1544
02:05:04,464 --> 02:05:05,839
That's next door.
- Darn.

1545
02:05:05,922 --> 02:05:11,300
Unless, Mr. Kapoor,
we change our advertising campaign.

1546
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:13,130
Over the last few days..

1547
02:05:13,214 --> 02:05:15,800
..we have auditioned
hundreds of girls for the part.

1548
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:18,800
But none of them have moved
my heart the way you have.

1549
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,797
If you love your baby and wife..

1550
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,589
..Booboo diapers is the choice.

1551
02:05:22,672 --> 02:05:23,922
It's brilliant!

1552
02:05:24,005 --> 02:05:26,505
So if we change our campaign..

1553
02:05:26,589 --> 02:05:30,380
..and instead of a wife and
a mother talking about her baby..

1554
02:05:30,464 --> 02:05:32,464
..we'll use your idea of a father..

1555
02:05:32,547 --> 02:05:34,797
..talking about his baby and wife.

1556
02:05:35,205 --> 02:05:36,967
That's so very innovative!

1557
02:05:37,047 --> 02:05:40,714
Mr. Kapoor, would you like to be
the face of Booboo diapers?

1558
02:05:42,505 --> 02:05:45,483
Sure. Thank you, sir.

1559
02:05:49,921 --> 02:05:51,630
This is the study.
- Okay.

1560
02:05:51,838 --> 02:05:53,546
And that's Vishal's room.

1561
02:05:54,046 --> 02:05:56,800
You can pick anything you
like from his wardrobe. - Okay.

1562
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:58,421
I think it should fit you just fine.

1563
02:05:59,296 --> 02:06:00,630
Agastya.

1564
02:06:01,755 --> 02:06:04,546
They are my mother's parents.
- What a beautiful painting!

1565
02:06:04,630 --> 02:06:07,255
When grandpa had
proposed to granny..

1566
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:10,380
..then he had captured
this romantic moment on canvas.

1567
02:06:10,463 --> 02:06:12,796
That's very romantic!
- And this is the same ring. See.

1568
02:06:15,005 --> 02:06:16,171
Yes.

1569
02:06:17,505 --> 02:06:20,838
You get ready. We are waiting
for you downstairs. - Okay.

1570
02:06:23,088 --> 02:06:24,675
Hello.
- May I speak to Piya, please?

1571
02:06:24,755 --> 02:06:26,677
Who is calling?
- This is Richa here.

1572
02:06:26,757 --> 02:06:29,755
Hey, Richa! Where are you?
You've disappeared.

1573
02:06:29,838 --> 02:06:32,046
Forget about me,
tell me about you.

1574
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:36,163
I saw you with
a handsome man yesterday.

1575
02:06:36,243 --> 02:06:38,171
That was Champu.
Didn't you recognize him?

1576
02:06:38,423 --> 02:06:39,588
Champu?

1577
02:06:39,796 --> 02:06:41,505
Yes. Champu from college.

1578
02:06:41,757 --> 02:06:43,508
That handsome! You lucky girl!

1579
02:06:43,588 --> 02:06:45,296
Oh, no! It's nothing like that.

1580
02:06:45,838 --> 02:06:47,255
Oh, really?

1581
02:06:47,338 --> 02:06:51,816
Yes! He still loves the girl
he adored in college.

1582
02:06:52,113 --> 02:06:54,330
You're right.
And you were that girl.

1583
02:06:55,005 --> 02:06:59,276
You didn't know? How would you?
You were so madly in love with Suhan.

1584
02:07:00,066 --> 02:07:02,716
When he saw you with Suhan..

1585
02:07:02,796 --> 02:07:06,671
..on prom night, he was heartbroken.
That was why he had left college.

1586
02:08:08,755 --> 02:08:11,737
Piya, will you marry me?

1587
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:18,046
Agastya has proposed to Piya!

1588
02:08:18,126 --> 02:08:21,880
No! No! Wait, wait!

1589
02:08:54,227 --> 02:08:57,421
Yes!

1590
02:09:47,050 --> 02:09:50,633
"You've crossed your limit.
What have you done?"

1591
02:09:50,713 --> 02:09:54,671
"You've made him go
crazy about you."

1592
02:09:55,566 --> 02:10:02,880
"I used to love her.
She was my classmate."

1593
02:10:02,963 --> 02:10:06,591
"She always used to be
upset with me."

1594
02:10:06,671 --> 02:10:10,338
"She used to ignore me."

1595
02:10:10,421 --> 02:10:15,091
"She used to ignore me."

1596
02:10:15,171 --> 02:10:18,755
"Can't you see?
He's in love with you."

1597
02:10:18,838 --> 02:10:22,005
"Say I do. I do. I do."

1598
02:10:22,505 --> 02:10:25,963
"Sister, say yes. Say yes!"

1599
02:10:26,046 --> 02:10:28,716
"Say yes! Say yes!"

1600
02:10:28,796 --> 02:10:32,588
"Give your consent.
- Please accept."

1601
02:10:32,671 --> 02:10:36,341
"Give your consent.
- Covertly and shyly, say yes."

1602
02:10:36,421 --> 02:10:40,008
"Give your consent.
- By a gesture or a sign."

1603
02:10:40,088 --> 02:10:43,285
"Give your consent."

1604
02:10:44,136 --> 02:10:45,841
Yes!

1605
02:10:45,921 --> 02:10:51,061
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
the new face of BooBoo diapers..

1606
02:10:51,703 --> 02:10:54,457
Suhan Kapoor.
- Yes!

1607
02:10:54,801 --> 02:10:55,963
Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1608
02:10:56,043 --> 02:10:58,588
Thank you very much.
Thank you, everybody.

1609
02:11:36,588 --> 02:11:39,963
"This guy is very nice."

1610
02:11:40,292 --> 02:11:43,713
"He seems to be a good person."

1611
02:11:44,044 --> 02:11:47,591
"If you say seven nuptial rounds."

1612
02:11:47,671 --> 02:11:51,088
"He may even take more than that."

1613
02:11:51,412 --> 02:11:54,380
"Listen! Listen!"

1614
02:11:55,068 --> 02:11:58,546
"The past never comes back."

1615
02:11:58,789 --> 02:12:02,088
"Come. Come on."

1616
02:12:02,493 --> 02:12:05,880
"Don't lose this chance."

1617
02:12:07,085 --> 02:12:10,758
"I love you."

1618
02:12:10,838 --> 02:12:14,449
"I would even give up
my life for you."

1619
02:12:14,529 --> 02:12:19,758
"I've come with a request."

1620
02:12:19,838 --> 02:12:26,463
"If you consent,
I want to marry you. I love you."

1621
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:30,258
"He's so handsome. He's a dude."

1622
02:12:30,338 --> 02:12:33,547
"Say 'I do'. I do. I do."

1623
02:12:33,627 --> 02:12:37,216
"Sister, don't refuse now.
Don't harass us."

1624
02:12:37,296 --> 02:12:40,255
"Marry him, and don't turn back."

1625
02:12:40,335 --> 02:12:44,049
"Give your consent.
- Grab the chance."

1626
02:12:44,129 --> 02:12:47,716
"Give your consent.
- It is the way of decent people."

1627
02:12:47,796 --> 02:12:51,383
"Give your consent.
- It is the hope of years."

1628
02:12:51,463 --> 02:12:54,730
"Give your consent."

1629
02:13:38,421 --> 02:13:41,938
"His voice is sweet."

1630
02:13:42,171 --> 02:13:45,675
"I think he's a jolly fellow."

1631
02:13:45,755 --> 02:13:49,380
"Grab him with both hands.."

1632
02:13:49,463 --> 02:13:53,005
"..if you think he's a bit weak."

1633
02:13:53,218 --> 02:13:56,171
"Yes. Oh, yes."

1634
02:13:56,838 --> 02:14:00,208
"This is about coincidence."

1635
02:14:00,546 --> 02:14:03,713
"What? Oh, what?"

1636
02:14:04,046 --> 02:14:07,754
"This is the auspicious time."

1637
02:14:08,912 --> 02:14:16,216
"Whatever you like,
that will be my liking too."

1638
02:14:16,296 --> 02:14:22,255
"If you want the twilights
to become long.."

1639
02:14:22,338 --> 02:14:27,407
"I'll shorten the days."

1640
02:14:28,505 --> 02:14:32,026
"Girl, he's too good to be true."

1641
02:14:32,106 --> 02:14:35,383
"Say 'I do'. I do. I do."

1642
02:14:35,463 --> 02:14:39,020
"Sister, do say yes.
Listen to us children."

1643
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:42,205
"Otherwise, this auspicious time
will pass away."

1644
02:14:42,595 --> 02:14:45,531
"Give your consent."

1645
02:14:46,076 --> 02:14:49,716
"Give your consent.
- This is the best thing for you."

1646
02:14:49,796 --> 02:14:53,383
"Give your consent.
- You are destined for him."

1647
02:14:53,463 --> 02:14:57,175
"Give your consent.
- What has to happen will happen."

1648
02:14:57,255 --> 02:15:00,477
"Give your consent."

1649
02:15:02,098 --> 02:15:05,024
I have got work.
I've become a model.

1650
02:15:05,671 --> 02:15:07,380
The contract is in my hand.

1651
02:15:08,796 --> 02:15:10,883
Now I can take care
of Piya and Suhani.

1652
02:15:10,963 --> 02:15:13,838
But Suhan,
what will you say to Agastya?

1653
02:15:19,511 --> 02:15:21,338
I'll tell the truth.

1654
02:15:22,588 --> 02:15:24,130
I've wronged him.

1655
02:15:24,547 --> 02:15:27,938
I'll accept any punishment
he hands to me.

1656
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:30,670
Very good!

1657
02:15:39,010 --> 02:15:40,218
I accept.

1658
02:15:40,298 --> 02:15:42,338
Yes!

1659
02:16:44,129 --> 02:16:45,053
Bye!

1660
02:16:45,134 --> 02:16:46,921
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1661
02:18:13,379 --> 02:18:14,715
Suhan!

1662
02:18:15,296 --> 02:18:16,713
Suhan!

1663
02:18:19,950 --> 02:18:23,046
Suhan, I want to tell you something.

1664
02:18:23,513 --> 02:18:25,379
You'll be so happy. See this!

1665
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:32,588
Sorry. Look.

1666
02:18:35,788 --> 02:18:37,088
I got engaged to Piya.

1667
02:19:16,683 --> 02:19:19,949
Meet my would-be wife. Piya Rao.

1668
02:19:52,148 --> 02:19:53,644
Boney speaking.

1669
02:19:55,492 --> 02:19:56,787
Hello?

1670
02:19:57,197 --> 02:20:00,453
Congratulation uncle, we've done it.
Our mission was a success.

1671
02:20:00,892 --> 02:20:02,948
Piya has got engaged to Agastya.

1672
02:20:04,197 --> 02:20:06,001
They are going to marry very soon.

1673
02:20:06,493 --> 02:20:09,476
Now there's no need to worry.
The whole matter is resolved.

1674
02:20:09,820 --> 02:20:13,870
Suhan, don't accept defeat so soon.
I have an excellent idea.

1675
02:20:13,950 --> 02:20:16,365
You do one thing..
- No. Not today.

1676
02:20:17,271 --> 02:20:19,370
Today, don't give me
any of your lousy ideas.

1677
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:21,239
You've always given me wrong advice.

1678
02:20:21,319 --> 02:20:22,990
Today, I won't listen
to a thing you say.

1679
02:20:23,219 --> 02:20:26,087
How had Piya wronged us?
She hadn't.

1680
02:20:26,896 --> 02:20:30,476
And I..I've only given her hurt.

1681
02:20:31,391 --> 02:20:32,895
Now, no more.

1682
02:20:33,274 --> 02:20:36,335
I've seen Piya. She's very happy.

1683
02:20:37,091 --> 02:20:39,089
Agastya loves her a lot.

1684
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:42,221
And he'll always keep her happy.

1685
02:20:44,218 --> 02:20:45,882
Because he's not like me.

1686
02:20:47,853 --> 02:20:51,619
His love doesn't change with
circumstances like mine does.

1687
02:20:53,220 --> 02:20:59,449
Do you know, when he found
out Piya loved somebody else..

1688
02:21:00,266 --> 02:21:02,058
..his love didn't change.

1689
02:21:02,849 --> 02:21:06,180
When he came to know that
Piya had got married..

1690
02:21:06,909 --> 02:21:08,652
..still his love didn't change.

1691
02:21:09,435 --> 02:21:12,522
And when he came to know
that Piya has a child..

1692
02:21:12,602 --> 02:21:14,599
..still his love didn't change.

1693
02:21:15,742 --> 02:21:20,941
Uncle, Agastya's love
for Piya will never wane.

1694
02:21:24,699 --> 02:21:26,423
He's really an angel.

1695
02:21:28,288 --> 02:21:29,520
And I..

1696
02:21:31,438 --> 02:21:33,831
I could never make Piya happy.

1697
02:21:34,667 --> 02:21:38,978
But I can at least
let her stay happy.

1698
02:21:41,468 --> 02:21:42,885
I'm hanging up now.

1699
02:22:26,196 --> 02:22:27,313
Yes?

1700
02:22:32,618 --> 02:22:33,867
Yes. Who is it?

1701
02:22:42,586 --> 02:22:43,668
Suhan!

1702
02:23:22,307 --> 02:23:23,784
You got your love Piya.

1703
02:23:24,162 --> 02:23:25,940
I've kept my promise.

1704
02:23:26,178 --> 02:23:27,779
My role ends here.

1705
02:23:28,113 --> 02:23:29,864
You don't need me anymore.

1706
02:23:29,944 --> 02:23:33,518
I'm sure you'll take
good care of Piya.

1707
02:23:33,690 --> 02:23:34,905
Take care, Agastya.

1708
02:23:36,382 --> 02:23:38,802
Suhan went away. Me too.

1709
02:23:39,322 --> 02:23:41,637
Piya and I were
to be married shortly.

1710
02:23:42,239 --> 02:23:44,346
I shifted into Piya's parents' home.

1711
02:24:08,523 --> 02:24:13,142
If you love your child and your wife,
BooBoo diapers is the right choice.

1712
02:24:13,614 --> 02:24:16,194
Cut it!
- Suhan decided to go back to India..

1713
02:24:16,554 --> 02:24:18,482
..after completing the
modelling assignment.

1714
02:24:21,605 --> 02:24:26,572
"There are a hundred pains.."

1715
02:24:27,105 --> 02:24:31,670
"There are a hundred ways of relief."

1716
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:37,134
"I've got everything, my love."

1717
02:24:37,214 --> 02:24:42,852
"Only you aren't there."

1718
02:24:53,717 --> 02:24:58,362
"There are a hundred pains."

1719
02:24:59,049 --> 02:25:03,697
"There are a hundred ways of relief."

1720
02:25:03,777 --> 02:25:09,200
"I've got everything, my love."

1721
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:15,114
"Only you aren't there."

1722
02:25:30,633 --> 02:25:33,947
Without Suhan, I was like a puppet
without the puppet-master.

1723
02:25:35,498 --> 02:25:37,760
Neither could I
talk freely with Piya..

1724
02:25:42,713 --> 02:25:44,572
..nor keep her happy.

1725
02:26:06,812 --> 02:26:11,392
I wanted Suhan to come and save me.

1726
02:26:13,585 --> 02:26:17,072
"This breeze that blows haltingly.."

1727
02:26:18,932 --> 02:26:22,195
"..why is it so indifferent."

1728
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:27,432
"On the busy streets.."

1729
02:26:29,531 --> 02:26:33,133
"..I come flying."

1730
02:26:34,415 --> 02:26:39,159
"There are a hundred ways."

1731
02:26:39,239 --> 02:26:44,920
"But there's no way for me."

1732
02:26:55,742 --> 02:27:00,044
"There are a hundred pains."

1733
02:27:01,046 --> 02:27:05,285
"There are a hundred ways of relief."

1734
02:27:05,787 --> 02:27:10,989
"I've got everything, my love."

1735
02:27:11,268 --> 02:27:16,802
"Only you aren't there."

1736
02:28:05,668 --> 02:28:09,697
"Let the water flow on."

1737
02:28:10,940 --> 02:28:14,800
"Let the time stand still."

1738
02:28:16,227 --> 02:28:20,422
"If the sea has turned."

1739
02:28:21,513 --> 02:28:25,119
"Let the shore endure it."

1740
02:28:26,325 --> 02:28:30,901
"I have a hundred wishes."

1741
02:28:31,262 --> 02:28:36,793
"But not your sorrow."

1742
02:28:42,566 --> 02:28:47,804
"Alone."

1743
02:28:47,884 --> 02:28:50,461
"Alone you are,
alone you must go on."

1744
02:28:50,541 --> 02:28:53,039
"Alone."

1745
02:28:53,119 --> 02:28:56,734
"There are a hundred pains."

1746
02:28:58,445 --> 02:29:02,163
"There are a hundred ways of relief."

1747
02:29:28,195 --> 02:29:29,739
Vishal, you had promised me..
- Zubin, just take it easy.

1748
02:29:29,819 --> 02:29:33,364
..that Piya would marry me.
- Hi. - Hi brother-in-law.

1749
02:29:34,239 --> 02:29:35,322
Come join us for a drink.

1750
02:29:35,402 --> 02:29:36,950
No, no.
- Just one drink.

1751
02:29:37,030 --> 02:29:38,295
I don't drink,
I swear I don't drink.

1752
02:29:38,375 --> 02:29:39,197
One drink.

1753
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:43,030
You shouldn't say that.
Vishal is your brother-in-law.

1754
02:29:43,697 --> 02:29:47,447
And when the brother-in-law says you
should drink, then you should. Here.

1755
02:29:48,655 --> 02:29:49,947
If this brother-in-law gets angry..

1756
02:29:50,030 --> 02:29:52,655
..your plight will be the same
as that of Piya's first husband.

1757
02:29:53,489 --> 02:29:56,072
What happened?
- Didn't you know? - No.

1758
02:29:56,354 --> 02:29:59,325
Piya's divorce was
because of Vishal. Because of him.

1759
02:29:59,405 --> 02:30:00,905
Zubin, you're drunk.

1760
02:30:01,746 --> 02:30:03,905
You don't believe me?
You don't believe me?

1761
02:30:04,183 --> 02:30:06,617
I'll just show you.
- Zubin! Zubin, just take it easy.

1762
02:30:06,697 --> 02:30:08,697
All those letters that Piya's..

1763
02:30:08,917 --> 02:30:11,780
..husband had written for Piya.

1764
02:30:12,075 --> 02:30:14,447
But not one of these
letters reached Piya.

1765
02:30:14,635 --> 02:30:18,089
Vishal hid all these letters here.

1766
02:30:18,169 --> 02:30:21,116
He didn't even give the
two a chance to reunite.

1767
02:30:23,333 --> 02:30:25,073
Scoundrel.
- Shut up, Zubin.

1768
02:30:25,153 --> 02:30:28,073
It was another matter with that guy.
He was a good for nothing.

1769
02:30:29,729 --> 02:30:30,998
But I like Agastya.

1770
02:30:32,221 --> 02:30:34,579
I'm sure
he'll take good care of Piya.

1771
02:30:35,142 --> 02:30:36,531
Am I right?
- Sure.

1772
02:30:36,611 --> 02:30:37,990
Cheers.
- Cheers.

1773
02:31:54,970 --> 02:31:57,222
Come on.

1774
02:33:03,779 --> 02:33:04,931
Hey!

1775
02:33:10,729 --> 02:33:11,952
Thank you.

1776
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:45,531
Hi, kid. I'm back.

1777
02:33:46,096 --> 02:33:48,948
I've brought something for you.
Do you want to see what it is?

1778
02:33:59,583 --> 02:34:01,490
This is for you.

1779
02:34:03,744 --> 02:34:06,085
Oh. You don't recognise me?

1780
02:34:06,428 --> 02:34:11,326
One moment. And.

1781
02:34:13,031 --> 02:34:14,591
And..

1782
02:34:15,289 --> 02:34:16,906
Here.

1783
02:34:18,281 --> 02:34:19,643
Here.

1784
02:34:21,790 --> 02:34:24,218
This may be the last time
I'll get to meet you.

1785
02:34:27,517 --> 02:34:31,106
I had planned to take you with me.

1786
02:34:31,915 --> 02:34:35,531
Later, I planned
to take your mother with us.

1787
02:34:36,138 --> 02:34:39,740
But I have to go alone.

1788
02:34:40,932 --> 02:34:42,771
All my plans failed miserably.

1789
02:34:47,169 --> 02:34:48,749
Will you heed my words?

1790
02:34:50,943 --> 02:34:54,624
When you grow up, don't be like me..

1791
02:34:55,798 --> 02:34:57,540
..be like your mother.

1792
02:35:02,054 --> 02:35:04,790
I love you. I love you.

1793
02:35:08,194 --> 02:35:09,499
I love you.

1794
02:35:31,067 --> 02:35:33,707
All your manipulations failed.
So you've stooped to this?

1795
02:35:33,787 --> 02:35:36,990
Vishal. - No, Dad. Last time too,
I was quiet because of you.

1796
02:35:37,070 --> 02:35:38,565
That's why all this has happened.

1797
02:35:38,645 --> 02:35:40,147
He came to kidnap the child.

1798
02:35:40,613 --> 02:35:43,367
But Dad, I'll hand him
over to the police.

1799
02:35:43,729 --> 02:35:46,150
Otherwise, he will..
- Vishal, enough is enough.

1800
02:35:47,414 --> 02:35:49,275
Suhan is part of our family.

1801
02:35:50,255 --> 02:35:53,282
We don't need to involve the
police in this family matter.

1802
02:35:54,531 --> 02:35:58,166
Suhan, it's your child too.

1803
02:36:00,075 --> 02:36:02,203
I can understand your position.

1804
02:36:02,715 --> 02:36:05,142
But this isn't the right way.

1805
02:36:06,216 --> 02:36:08,890
If you want the child's custody..

1806
02:36:09,541 --> 02:36:11,828
..fight it out legally,
properly in the court.

1807
02:36:13,385 --> 02:36:17,142
We'll abide
by the court's judgement.

1808
02:36:17,222 --> 02:36:19,782
Security, escort him out.

1809
02:39:38,900 --> 02:39:40,900
Suhan committed a grave mistake.

1810
02:39:43,346 --> 02:39:45,637
But that mistake was not his fault.

1811
02:39:48,262 --> 02:39:51,471
He too was a victim of the
misunderstanding created by Vishal.

1812
02:39:54,221 --> 02:39:56,762
I know that Suhan loves you a lot.

1813
02:39:58,596 --> 02:39:59,887
And you love him too.

1814
02:40:02,054 --> 02:40:03,971
I've just come
between the two of you.

1815
02:40:06,221 --> 02:40:08,137
How could you love me?

1816
02:40:10,304 --> 02:40:11,679
I'm only Champu.

1817
02:40:12,971 --> 02:40:14,221
An idiot.

1818
02:40:16,804 --> 02:40:19,262
I can't even talk to you properly.

1819
02:40:21,804 --> 02:40:27,721
And then, you haven't fallen in love
with me but with Suhan once again.

1820
02:40:30,221 --> 02:40:32,512
Whatever I said to you.

1821
02:40:34,137 --> 02:40:36,971
Whatever I did for you.

1822
02:40:38,471 --> 02:40:41,179
That was not me, but Suhan.

1823
02:40:44,137 --> 02:40:45,679
I was only the body.

1824
02:40:49,262 --> 02:40:55,179
Piya, you shouldn't be with me
but with Suhan.

1825
02:40:56,804 --> 02:40:59,012
You are made for each other.

1826
02:41:00,599 --> 02:41:02,637
Suhan loves you a lot.

1827
02:41:04,887 --> 02:41:07,512
When he thought that
you were happy with me..

1828
02:41:09,887 --> 02:41:12,679
..he left everybody
for your happiness.

1829
02:41:14,346 --> 02:41:17,137
Suhan will be shattered
without you, Piya.

1830
02:41:18,971 --> 02:41:20,471
He needs you.

1831
02:41:22,221 --> 02:41:24,179
Suhan loves you a lot.

1832
02:41:26,096 --> 02:41:27,929
Without you, Suhan..

1833
02:41:30,679 --> 02:41:32,221
Suhan..

1834
02:41:34,387 --> 02:41:35,721
Suhan..

1835
02:41:36,179 --> 02:41:38,054
Please don't stop, Agastya.

1836
02:41:48,471 --> 02:41:51,857
No one says
anything good about Suhan.

1837
02:41:54,804 --> 02:41:59,150
Today for the first time, I'm
hearing something good about him.

1838
02:42:00,304 --> 02:42:01,971
Please don't stop.

1839
02:42:04,096 --> 02:42:05,971
Yes, Suhan is a..

1840
02:42:06,929 --> 02:42:09,349
I like to hear
good things about him.

1841
02:42:09,429 --> 02:42:11,262
He's a good person.

1842
02:42:13,637 --> 02:42:15,262
Please don't stop.

1843
02:42:15,762 --> 02:42:18,117
He loves you a lot.

1844
02:43:13,206 --> 02:43:13,878
Hello, Vikas?

1845
02:43:13,958 --> 02:43:15,310
Hi, sir. When did you return?

1846
02:43:15,390 --> 02:43:17,126
Last night. Any work for me?

1847
02:43:17,206 --> 02:43:20,629
Yes, sir. There's work, but no
male lead. Nothing worthy of you.

1848
02:43:20,709 --> 02:43:24,766
Any role will do, even side roles..

1849
02:43:24,846 --> 02:43:26,465
I've an offer for a Bhojpuri
(Indian regional) film, sir.

1850
02:43:26,545 --> 02:43:27,422
Bhojpuri ?

1851
02:43:27,502 --> 02:43:29,412
Yes, sir.
- Of course, it'll do.

1852
02:43:56,568 --> 02:43:57,879
Cut. Okay.

1853
02:44:02,823 --> 02:44:06,959
Oh, mind-blowing. What a great shot!
Come, let's see the take. Come on.

1854
02:44:19,082 --> 02:44:20,665
Autograph please!

1855
02:44:34,137 --> 02:44:36,932
Piya how come you are here?

1856
02:44:38,347 --> 02:44:41,454
I...
- Suhan, please don't say anything.

1857
02:44:43,001 --> 02:44:44,850
We can't wait anymore.

1858
02:45:31,336 --> 02:45:34,794
Champu, I know that you're here.
Come out.

1859
02:45:34,874 --> 02:45:37,669
No, Suhan, my role ends here.

1860
02:45:38,224 --> 02:45:41,725
I have to leave now.
I was never suited to this world.

1861
02:45:42,508 --> 02:45:44,127
My purpose is elsewhere.

1862
02:46:10,583 --> 02:46:11,886
Thank you.

1863
02:46:14,068 --> 02:46:17,044
She is the only woman
you've ever loved.

1864
02:46:17,455 --> 02:46:20,755
Then how did you
fall in love with me?

1865
02:46:24,247 --> 02:46:27,871
You'll get your answers when
you speak to Piya and Suhan.

1866
02:46:30,512 --> 02:46:32,721
It's 8 o'clock there and
I'm sure they must have woken up.

1867
02:46:32,801 --> 02:46:35,297
Let's call my friend. Come.
- Okay.

1868
02:46:36,177 --> 02:46:37,596
Switch it on. Please.

1869
02:46:43,456 --> 02:46:45,303
Happy birthday, Suhan!

1870
02:46:46,412 --> 02:46:47,512
Thank you, Champu.

1871
02:46:48,282 --> 02:46:50,554
Not Champu. Agastya Rao.

1872
02:46:50,842 --> 02:46:53,687
I have a respectable reputation in space.
- Where had you disappeared?

1873
02:46:53,887 --> 02:46:56,557
It's a long, long story.
I'll tell you some other time.

1874
02:46:56,637 --> 02:46:58,179
But where is Piya?

1875
02:46:59,362 --> 02:47:02,766
You scoundrel. At least now, let her
go. She's now your sister-in-law.

1876
02:47:02,846 --> 02:47:05,804
Shut up! Just call Piya!
Just call her. Call her right now.

1877
02:47:06,804 --> 02:47:08,596
Piya!
- Yes.

1878
02:47:09,212 --> 02:47:10,637
Come here, Piya!

1879
02:47:11,733 --> 02:47:13,637
What happened?
- There's a surprise for you.

1880
02:47:14,433 --> 02:47:15,762
The surprise better be good.

1881
02:47:16,553 --> 02:47:19,724
Oh, my God!
Champu, where had you disappeared?

1882
02:47:22,891 --> 02:47:24,422
Say something.

1883
02:47:26,199 --> 02:47:28,900
I want to give both of you a surprise.
Are you ready for it?

1884
02:47:28,980 --> 02:47:31,099
Show the surprise fast!
- Shut up!

1885
02:47:35,075 --> 02:47:36,951
Come, come.

1886
02:47:37,031 --> 02:47:39,263
My girlfriend Preity Zintakova.

1887
02:47:41,928 --> 02:47:43,803
Zintakova..va?

1888
02:47:43,883 --> 02:47:47,409
Remember, Suhan? I had told you
there are seven people with one face.

1889
02:47:50,561 --> 02:47:52,034
Isn't she beautiful?

1890
02:47:52,114 --> 02:47:55,162
Wow! She looks exactly like me!

1891
02:47:55,496 --> 02:47:58,171
I mean I look exactly like you.

1892
02:47:58,251 --> 02:48:00,617
Oh, my God! Yes!
Suhan, she looks exactly like me!

1893
02:48:00,697 --> 02:48:02,888
It would be wonderful, if we could
just meet. - How old is Suhani now?

1894
02:48:02,968 --> 02:48:04,463
We are going to be
in the next 6 months.

1895
02:48:04,543 --> 02:48:05,791
We are going to be in Houston.

1896
02:48:05,871 --> 02:48:08,290
So you should come and see me and
Agastya. - Yes, we will! - Yes, yes.

1897
02:48:08,370 --> 02:48:10,807
We'll definitely come to Houston.
But you must come to Mumbai first!

1898
02:48:10,887 --> 02:48:12,583
Yes, yes. We'll
definitely come to Mumbai.

1899
02:48:12,663 --> 02:48:15,451
We love you.
- I'm a big TV star here.

1900
02:48:16,006 --> 02:48:17,773
You know he's really funny.
That's his sense of humour.

1901
02:48:17,853 --> 02:48:19,992
I'll kill you!
- But..

1902
02:48:20,414 --> 02:48:22,332
He talks about you all the time.

1903
02:48:22,851 --> 02:48:24,232
How old are you?

1904
02:48:24,918 --> 02:48:28,242
Yes. You must take care of Agastya.
You know we absolutely love him.

1905
02:48:28,322 --> 02:48:30,513
I can't believe it.
This is like a dream.

1906
02:48:31,982 --> 02:48:33,786
Yes! Take care of yourself!

1907
02:49:02,863 --> 02:49:07,421
"We know love is naive."

1908
02:49:07,501 --> 02:49:13,838
"The heart makes mistakes."

1909
02:49:14,390 --> 02:49:18,838
"Love is oblivious of patience."

1910
02:49:21,123 --> 02:49:25,646
"We know love is naive."

1911
02:49:25,726 --> 02:49:31,768
"The heart makes mistakes."

1912
02:49:32,510 --> 02:49:37,464
"Love is oblivious of patience."

1913
02:50:02,489 --> 02:50:04,421
"My love."

1914
02:50:04,823 --> 02:50:06,463
"My love."

1915
02:50:07,137 --> 02:50:09,299
"My love."

1916
02:50:09,379 --> 02:50:11,326
"My love."

1917
02:51:15,469 --> 02:51:19,959
"We know love is naive."

1918
02:51:20,039 --> 02:51:26,728
"The heart makes mistakes."

1919
02:51:26,808 --> 02:51:31,307
"Love is oblivious of patience."
